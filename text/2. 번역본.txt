A Study on the Experience of Community Gardening Activities Based on Social Prescribing

Abstract

Objectives: This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of community gardening, one of the prescribed pilot social programs conducted on elderly people living in rural areas.
Methods: This study used experiences that were extracted from focus group interviews of 12 elderly people and analyzed using Colaizziâ€™s phenomenological method.
Results: Three categories and a set of seven theme clusters of the meaning of fatigue [translator's note: the abstract says 'fatigue' but based on the content, this likely meant 'experience' or similar] were derived. The three categories are: opportunities for sharing, building and strengthening social networks, and opportunities for social participation.
Conclusion: First, this study suggests that rather than providing new health promotion programs or services to the elderly living in rural areas, daily activities familiar to them should be included in the community-centered programs or services. Second, this study suggests that services should be established in connection with the elderly living in rural areas within the community. Third, it is expected that community gardening is conducted as part of Social Prescribing Pilot Project. Therefore, it is possible to present a plan to utilize gardening in the Community integrated care service policy currently implemented in Korea.

I. Introduction

The proportion of the elderly population aged 65 and over in South Korea is increasing at the fastest rate among OECD countries. According to Statistics Korea, by 2050, the proportion of the elderly population aged 65 and over in Korea is predicted to increase to about 40%, making it the most aged country in the world. In response to this rapidly increasing elderly population ratio, the health paradigm has shifted from a disease-centered to a prevention-centered approach, and national policies have also transitioned from disease treatment to prevention focus. Consequently, interest in health promotion and prevention has grown (Breslow, 1999).

According to the WHO, health promotion refers to encouraging healthy lifestyles, creating supportive environments for health, strengthening community activities, and establishing healthy public policies, targeting not only individuals but also families and the communities they live in. Since the ultimate goal of health promotion is to maintain health balance, individuals should practice healthy habits in their daily lives, and communities should create environments and provide services that enable residents to adopt healthy lifestyles (Bracht, 1999).

Community gardening is one such community-provided service for health promotion, easily accessible to residents and implemented in many countries (Thompson, 2018). Unlike private gardening, community gardening involves collaborating and interacting with neighbors within the community to plant and cultivate crops collectively (Ferris, Norman, & Sempik, 2001). The specific purpose of community gardening varies depending on the community's characteristics. For instance, in ethnically diverse areas, it aims for social integration; in communities with economic hardship or low-income residents, it focuses on nutrition; and in areas with high rates of chronic diseases or obesity, it aims to increase fruit and vegetable consumption (Litt et al., 2011; Drake & Lawson, 2015; Castro, Samuels, & Harman, 2013). Although the purposes differ, community gardening allows residents to improve their physical, mental, and social health (Egli, Oliver, & Tautolo, 2016).

In communities with a high proportion of elderly residents, community gardening helps promote physical activity and subjective well-being through the formation of exercise habits, increases health status by encouraging balanced diets through vegetable consumption, and strengthens relationships with neighbors, thereby enhancing the physical, mental, and social health of the elderly (Machida, 2019). As such, community gardening, an activity easily accessible and participable for the elderly in their daily lives, is also offered within the UK's 'social prescribing' framework. Social prescribing is a prevention-focused policy of the National Health Service (NHS) that supports non-pharmacological treatments alongside pharmacological treatments prescribed by General Practitioners (GPs) for individuals within the community (Bickerdike, Booth, Wilson, Farley, & Wright, 2017). Non-pharmacological treatments in social prescribing include various community-linked services such as art therapy, music therapy, reading therapy, educational opportunities, exercise therapy, and green therapy (Chatterjee, Camic, Lockyer, & Thomson, 2018). Primary care recipients, especially the elderly, can achieve physical, mental, and social well-being and promote their health by participating in social prescribing programs (Chatterjee et al., 2018).

A social prescribing pilot project for the elderly is currently operating in Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. This project, located in a rural area with a high elderly population ratio, is a community care pilot project-type social prescribing initiative targeting residents aged 65 and over in Heungeup-myeon (Nam, 2020). The social prescribing pilot project in this study includes various programs for promoting the health of the elderly, with community gardening being one of them.

Therefore, this study aims to derive the meaning of health promotion from the experiences of elderly individuals engaging in community gardening in a rural area, thereby providing foundational data necessary for offering health promotion programs targeted at elderly residents in rural regions. The research questions are as follows:

First, what did the rural elderly experience through community gardening activities?
Second, what meaning does community gardening hold for the rural elderly?

II. Methods

1. Research Design

This study is an inductive, descriptive study using a phenomenological research method, a type of qualitative research. It aims to understand what elderly residents of Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do experienced through community gardening activities during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of a social prescribing pilot project, and what meaning these experiences hold for their health promotion.

2. Study Area

The study area is Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. The total population of Heungeup-myeon is 9,105, of which 1,624 (17.8%) are elderly aged 65 and over, a higher proportion compared to nearby urban areas. Heungeup-myeon hosts various community institutions, including three universities, a small library, an administrative welfare center, a multi-purpose welfare center, a local welfare center, a public health subcenter, a primary health care post, and the Wonju Agricultural Technology Center. It has a relatively large number of universities and educational institutions for a township (eup/myeon) area nationwide. Despite the large elderly population and numerous institutions available for community linkage, the services provided within the community are limited. Furthermore, due to COVID-19, institutions like the multi-purpose welfare center and the local welfare center were closed, resulting in a lack of healthy programs. Consequently, the Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center (hereafter 'Yonsei Healthy City Research Center'), which led this study, collaborated with the small library, administrative welfare center, and agricultural technology center in Heungeup-myeon to conduct outdoor community gardening activities.

3. Study Participants

The study participants were 12 low-income elderly individuals out of 21 recommended elderly aged 65 and over by the Heungeup-myeon Administrative Welfare Center in Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. They participated in the community gardening activity, part of the social prescribing pilot project, from May 8 to September 28, 2020. The Heungeup-myeon Administrative Welfare Center operated a customized welfare team and possessed information on key contacts, such as lists of senior centers (Gyeongro-dang) and their presidents within the township. Based on this information, the research team selected 12 participants who met the following criteria: normal cognitive function, no difficulties with physical mobility, consented to participate in the activity, did not have severe depression based on pre-survey results, and consented to photography, audio, and video recording for observation during the intervention program <Table 1>.

4. Intervention

The community gardening activity was initiated by the Yonsei Healthy City Research Center applying for and participating in an experiential gardening program offered by the Agricultural Technology Center in Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. This program, titled 'My Own Garden Cultivation Program,' provided participants with raised beds (duduk) and furrows (gorang), requiring them to manage and cultivate their plots independently. The Yonsei Healthy City Research Center received 11 raised beds under the agreement to manage and cultivate them until the end of the program.

The garden plots provided by the Agricultural Technology Center were jointly managed by the Yonsei Healthy City Research Center and the Haengbok Gadeuk Small Library in Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. The activity took place once a week for 18 weeks, from May 8 to September 28, 2020. Each week had a specific activity theme. Throughout the period, participants, along with university student volunteers and the research team, engaged in sowing, weeding, fertilizing, applying aphid repellent, harvesting, removing seedlings, cleaning, and organizing. The 12 participants, together with student volunteers, researchers, and the project lead professor, planted, grew, and harvested cherry tomatoes, peppers, corn, and sweet potatoes over approximately 18 weeks <Table 2>.

University student volunteers were recruited through announcements sent by the Yonsei Healthy City Research Center to the heads of the Health Administration and Social Welfare departments at the three local universities. A total of 11 students volunteered. Their role was to assist the elderly participants. As the participants were aged 65 and over, the student volunteers helped carry heavy items like fertilizer bags, pesticides, and harvested crops, and assisted the participants while they tended the garden. Student volunteers of both genders participated, with many involved particularly in the early stages to help create a comfortable gardening environment for the participants. The research team's role was to participate in and observe the gardening activities alongside the participants and student volunteers, and to identify any needs or difficulties experienced by the participants.

5. Data Collection and Methods

The data collection period for this study was from May to October 2020. Researchers participated in the gardening activities from May to September, observing the participants. Subsequently, in October, Focus Group Interviews (FGIs) were conducted. The FGIs were held separately for two groups: Group 1 (participants from sub-groups 1 & 2, n=6) and Group 2 (participants from sub-groups 3 & 4, n=6) (refer to Table 1). Considering the participants' age, the interviews were conducted at a pre-arranged time in a familiar gathering place to ensure a comfortable environment.

Before starting the interviews, the researchers clearly explained the purpose of the study and obtained consent before collecting data through the FGIs. The interviews lasted an average of 60-80 minutes. To prevent omission of conversational content, all interviews were audio-recorded with the participants' permission.

The FGI questions were based on those from "Growing urban health: Community gardening South-East Toronto" (Wakefield, Yeudall, Taron, Reynolds, & Skinner, 2007) and were reconstructed by two health experts and two participating researchers from the social prescribing pilot project, considering that the participants were elderly aged 65 and over <Table 3>. The reconstructed questions were unstructured and open-ended to encourage participants to share their experiences as naturally as possible.

(Table 3. Interview questions - Already provided in English)

6. Analysis Method

This study utilized Colaizzi's (1978) phenomenological method for analysis. Colaizzi's method consists of the following five steps:

Exploring the overall phenomenon by analyzing transcripts.
Extracting significant statements from phrases and sentences related to the research phenomenon.
Categorizing the extracted statements into theme clusters.
Describing the essential structure of the experience.
Reconfirming the validity of the results with the participants.
For data analysis in this study, researchers repeatedly listened to the recorded interview content while transcribing it into documents. After gaining an overall sense of the participants' feelings about the gardening activities through repeated reading, two health experts and two researchers involved in the gardening activities derived meanings from the research data, classifying them into 7 theme clusters. From these confirmed theme clusters, 3 categories were derived. Finally, to reconfirm the validity of the data analysis results, the researchers met with 4 participants to verify if the derived meanings corresponded to their experienced content.

7. Ethical Considerations

This study was conducted after receiving approval from the Yonsei University Institutional Review Board (IRB No. 1041849-202010-SB-154-02). Researchers explained the purpose and intent of the study to the participants and conducted the focus group interviews only after obtaining their voluntary consent. It was clearly explained that participants could stop the interview at any time if they wished, and that the interview content would not be used for purposes other than the research.

III. Research Results

1. General Characteristics of Participants

The study participants were 12 elderly individuals aged 65 and over residing in Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. All participants were female. Five were under 80 years old, and seven were 80 years or older, with an average age of 82.17 years. Nine participants lived alone, two lived with a spouse, and one lived with their children. Only two participants were literate (able to read and write), while ten reported they had not learned to read or write <Table 4>.

(Table 4. Characteristics of participants - Already provided in English)

2. Results of FGIs with Participants

Analysis of the data confirmed the experiences of participants who engaged in community gardening as part of the social prescribing pilot project. The researchers derived 7 theme clusters: 'Sharing life experiences and knowledge,' 'Opportunity to share scarce materials,' 'Connecting younger and older generations,' 'Strengthening family support,' 'Community interaction,' 'Work other than farming,' and 'Participation in another program.' Subsequently, 3 categories were derived: 'Opportunity to share resources,' 'Forming and strengthening participants' social networks,' and 'Another opportunity for social participation.'

Category 1: Opportunity to Share Resources
This category includes two theme clusters related to gardening activities: 'Sharing life knowledge' and 'Opportunity to share scarce materials.' Participants' statements revealed that they felt pride and accomplishment by sharing their experiences and knowledge with others, and by sharing necessary materials or tools.

(1) Sharing Life Experiences and Knowledge
Participants engaged in agriculture felt pride in teaching other participants and students, who were less experienced in gardening, about methods and timing for using fertilizer, assessing crop conditions, and techniques for good growth. One participant described herself as an 'agricultural expert.'

"We are farmers, so we wanted to go and help. I told them which vegetables needed fertilizer and when. It made me happy to see the students and the other elders (seongnim) doing it together. Look how well they grew despite all the rain." [82 yrs K., Participant 3]
"I couldn't even attend elementary school, I've only farmed my whole life. I can't read either. To learn anything, you need to read, but since I can't, I don't even want to learn. So when I meet grandmas who can read, I feel small. But that grandma didn't know how to farm. So I taught her how to plant tomatoes and set up stakes. I thought it wasn't a big deal, but telling her something I'm good at made me feel kind of proud." [82 yrs S., Participant 2]
"I told them how corn grows well, didn't I? To the students and others. I'm a farmer, so I know just by looking. I know what the corn's condition will be. It feels good telling them that. All the corn they ate grew well because of me, I taught them so well. After that, whenever it came to corn, everyone came to ask me. I'm the corn expert." [67 yrs H., Participant 9]
(2) Opportunity to Share Scarce Materials
Participants brought resources like fertilizer, manure, and seeds, which they used for their personal farming, to share with other participants during the gardening activity days. Despite these being personal assets, they felt pride and accomplishment in sharing resources to grow crops together with others.

"Well, when I first went to the garden, there was nothing there. So I brought all the fertilizer and manure I use in my field and gave it to them. That's why they ask me if they need anything. That's all I can give, but they use it while saying thank you, so how nice is that. I want to give them everything." [76 yrs L., Participant 7]
"I brought a whole can of corn seeds, didn't I? At first, I wondered if I brought it for nothing. Corn is too tiring to manage. But watching it grow, it looked so pretty. It felt great seeing (the crop) grow well." [67 yrs H., Participant 9]
Category 2: Forming and Strengthening Participants' Social Networks
This category includes three theme clusters: 'Connecting younger and older generations,' 'Strengthening family support,' and 'Community interaction.' Participants' statements indicated the formation of new social networks or the strengthening of existing social networks within families or the community.

(1) Connecting Younger and Older Generations
Participants expressed feelings of loneliness and anxiety or fear about life as they aged. However, through the gardening activity, they interacted with young students. This helped eliminate prejudice against young people, enabled them to empathize with their grandchildren, and they stated they did not feel lonely and slept well on the days they gardened with students.

"It was so nice doing it with the university students who are like my sons, grandsons, daughters, and granddaughters. I felt younger too, and when the young students called and asked to go to the garden together, I went feeling like I was going on a picnic. Where else can old people like us spend time with young students like this every week? Being with the students got rid of my prejudice against young people." [82 yrs S., Participant 2]
"It's so much better doing things with young students than just hanging out with old grandmas here all the time, they are all so nice. I have granddaughters and grandsons too, but I don't see them much except for Lunar New Year or Chuseok. While gardening with the students, I get to learn what young people these days like and how they have fun. When my grandchildren visit, our conversation time has become much longer than before. I think it's because I understand and empathize a bit more with what they say." [90 yrs K., Participant 1]
"Try farming alone all the time. It's incredibly boring and lonely. But plowing the field together, planting things, doing it with students is fun. It's funny when the students act cute to entertain us old folks. Laughing and chatting like that in the field, then going home without other thoughts and being able to sleep right away, how wonderful is that. Before, I couldn't sleep at night, had random thoughts, felt scared, but on the days I went to the garden, I sleep really well. Just thinking about the day I go to the garden makes me not lonely." [89 yrs S., Participant 6 - Corrected initial based on Table 1]
(2) Strengthening Family Support
Participants stated that their family support was strengthened through the gardening activity. One participant, worried because her husband was diagnosed with dementia, reported having more conversations with him while participating in the gardening. Another participant mentioned her relationship with her children improved, and notably, she found it easier to talk about her aches and pains than before.

"My husband and I have never farmed in our lives. When I told grandpa we planted tomatoes and sweet potatoes, he said 'Oh, well done' and was so happy. He seems pleased that I go and tend the garden. One time he wanted to visit the garden, so we went together, and after that, he asks to go together all the time. Thanks to the garden, grandpa and I have dates every day." [78 yrs L., Participant 8]
"When my son was young, he said he'd make a garden just for mom, and he's incredibly happy that I'm growing things here with people. He calls every day asking what I did. My voice and expression must have improved a lot since I started gardening. My son is so happy. He already told his older sister and younger sibling, so they call me every day too. So it's really nice, and if I'm sick somewhere, I can tell them right away." [84 yrs P., Participant 4]
(3) Community Interaction
Participants felt frustrated because senior centers and rest areas were closed due to COVID-19. However, the outdoor gardening activity allowed them to meet other neighbors in the garden, which they described as a picnic. They also shared harvested crops with local stores, forming relationships with the store owners based on this interaction.

"These days, you can't go out because of COVID-19. The senior center and rest area were closed too, so staying home all the time was frustrating and scary. But this (gardening) is done outside in a wide space, so I went out and did it together. Sitting outside together, talking about this and that, sharing snacks, it felt like a picnic and relieved a lot of stress." [82 yrs K., Participant 3]
"When I first shared the harvested tomatoes, peppers, and corn with the restaurant and hair salon, they were incredibly happy. The things I grow myself, I have to sell, so I couldn't share them. But the things we grew together here couldn't be sold, so I shared them. It felt really good. When I went with my daughter's family, they gave us extra service and told my daughter not to worry. They said they'd check in on the elder once in a while." [84 yrs P., Participant 4]
Category 3: Another Opportunity for Social Participation
Heungeup-myeon has jobs and programs for the elderly. However, most elderly are unaware of them, and programs were suspended, especially due to COVID-19. Most participants in this study were engaged in agriculture and spent much time at home due to COVID-19. By participating in the gardening activity, participants learned about job opportunities available for the elderly in the community and participated in other programs like mask making and doll making, besides gardening.

(1) Work Other than Farming
Through participating in the gardening activity, one participant learned from another participant about job opportunities besides farming. The participant expressed finding it fun to earn income from work other than farming.

"There's not much to do in the countryside. At most, go play at the senior center. Recently, because of COVID-19, you can't even go there. But an elder I pick peppers with asked me to clean around XX University together? At first, I didn't want to, so I ran away. But actually going there, seeing other people, not just staying home, and earning money too. Earning money from something other than farming is exciting in its own way, and I brag about it to others." [85 yrs A., Participant 12]
(2) Participation in Another Regular Program
Participants expressed satisfaction at being able to participate in another regular program besides the gardening activity. They mentioned that making dolls, masks, and air fresheners in the Haengbok Gadeuk Small Library's regular program was good for dementia prevention. They also felt proud that the items they made would be donated to low-income children or elderly individuals.

"Besides this (gardening), there's another program? They said there's a gathering for making dolls, COVID masks, and air fresheners, so I did it. It was so much fun. Since meeting people isn't possible due to COVID, you can do it at home. Making things. The volunteer student plays a video, and watching that while making masks is fun, and doing needlework and moving my hands after a long time helps prevent dementia. And they said the masks made are donated, how great is that." [78 yrs P., Participant 11]
"Gardening is fun because it's outdoors, and making dolls and air fresheners is fun in its own way. They say making dolls and stuff is good for dementia prevention, so I do it very diligently. At first, I wasn't used to making things while watching a video, but actually doing it, fiddling with my hands, is fun." [78 yrs L., Participant 8]
IV. Discussion

This study analyzed the experiences and derived meanings from elderly participants residing in Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do, who engaged in community gardening from May to September 2020 as part of a social prescribing pilot project. The researchers identified 3 categories: 'Opportunity to share resources,' 'Forming and strengthening participants' social networks,' and 'Another opportunity for social participation,' along with 7 themes: 'Sharing life experiences and knowledge,' 'Opportunity to share scarce materials,' 'Connecting younger and older generations,' 'Strengthening family support,' 'Community interaction,' 'Work other than farming,' and 'Participation in another program.'

First, through this activity, participants felt a sense of accomplishment and pride by sharing life wisdom and knowledge, such as farming methods and timely crop cultivation techniques, as well as sharing tools, materials, and resources used in their usual farming. When people share their knowledge or material possessions with others, they feel accomplishment and self-satisfaction, which positively influences psychological well-being (Veenhoven, 1991). While young people have many opportunities to enhance psychological well-being through various activities and experiences, the elderly, especially those in rural areas with less environmental change, have fewer such opportunities, leading to deepened feelings of isolation, loneliness, and life helplessness (Choi, 2004). Consequently, they lack interest in trying new challenges and tend not to deviate from their established routines and communities. Since the participants in this study were engaged in agriculture, gardening was a familiar and confident activity for them. Notably, participants with low literacy, who initially felt inferior to more educated elderly individuals, showed increased confidence and self-esteem as their participation in gardening activities lengthened. According to previous research, confidence and self-esteem are related to attitudes towards others; thus, improved confidence and self-esteem lead to positive changes in attitudes towards others (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985). Similarly, the participants in this study exhibited positive changes in their attitudes towards those they previously felt inferior to as their confidence and self-esteem improved. While participants felt a sense of helplessness before joining the gardening activity, sharing their knowledge and resources seems to have sparked new interest and improved their psychological well-being.

Second, this activity enabled participants to form healthy social networks with the younger generation (students), family members, and within the community. Forming healthy social networks is the most effective way to improve the quality of life for the elderly by providing support and assistance, positively impacting their mental health (Chang, 2010). The average age of the participants was 82.17 years, and having lived in a rural area for a long time, they had few opportunities to spend time with younger generations. However, interacting with young university students through gardening activities helped eliminate prejudice against the youth, fostered empathy, and appeared to build positive social networks within the community. This aligns with previous research suggesting the need for intergenerational education to promote communication between young and old generations, foster empathy and understanding, and requires community efforts to resolve intergenerational conflicts (Shin, 2016). The newly formed social ties with the younger generation, characterized by their bright and positive energy, positively influenced the participants' mental health, helping to alleviate anxiety about death stemming from negative thoughts and reduce depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the gardening activity strengthened relationships with family and community residents. Participants reported deeper connections with family members and increased contact frequency. They stated that as contact frequency increased and family relationships became more comfortable, they could more easily ask for help when feeling unwell, needing medication, or requiring hospital visits. This corresponds with prior research indicating that rural elderly experience higher life satisfaction when they have stronger relationships and higher contact frequency with their children compared to urban elderly (Bae, 2004). Additionally, participants expanded interaction with community residents, an important source of psychological well-being, thereby strengthening their support systems. Participants, whose outings were restricted due to COVID-19, described the gardening activity, where they could talk with people, as a 'picnic.' By sharing harvested crops with neighbors and local shop owners, they formed new social networks within the community, even leading to mutual inquiries about well-being extending to their children. Previous studies indicate that healthy social networks in old age lead to more active community involvement, which in turn positively impacts individual health (Song, Jo, & Nam, 2019). This study confirmed that relationships formed through gardening made community activities more vibrant, and this increased activity positively influenced their own health. Thus, community gardening proved to be a crucial factor in enhancing participants' social and psychological well-being.

Third, participants gained opportunities for further social participation through the gardening activity. According to previous research, productive activity in old age is necessary for maintaining active engagement in life and is a factor in successful aging (Rowe & Kahn, 1997). Rural elderly tend to have a limited scope of social participation, primarily maintained within primary groups (Park, Park, & Yum, 2015). One participant in this study also primarily engaged in farming and spent leisure time chatting with close neighbors at senior centers or rest areas, without active social participation. However, through interaction with another participant in the gardening activity, she took on a new role as a cleaner at a nearby university, starting economic activity beyond farming. She expressed excitement about earning income from non-farming activities and gained confidence. This aligns with research showing that acquiring new roles generates self-esteem in the elderly, enhancing psychological and social well-being (Cho, 2008). Other participants reported that participating in gardening enabled them to join regular programs like making dolls, masks, and air fresheners. Participants in these programs stated they enjoyed these activities as they were good for dementia prevention. This is consistent with studies suggesting that art therapy involving fine motor skills and concentration, such as crafting, is effective for dementia prevention in the elderly, and awareness of this benefit motivates them to engage more actively (Beard, 2012). Furthermore, they felt proud that the items they made were donated to community members in need (e.g., mobility-impaired elderly, multicultural families, students). This aligns with research indicating that such contributions generate self-efficacy, thereby enhancing psychological and social well-being (Kim et al., 2021).

The limitations of this study are as follows. First, the number of participants in the gardening activity was small. This was due to the limited number of participants recommended by the administrative welfare center because of COVID-19. However, conducting the gardening activity with a small group potentially increased participant satisfaction, which could lead to improved psychological and social well-being. Second, this study could not confirm improvements in physical factors. As most participants were primarily engaged in farming, results indicating improvement or enhancement in physical function through gardening could not be confirmed. Therefore, future research comparing the physical enhancement effects of gardening activities is deemed necessary.

V. Conclusion

This study aimed to understand the essential experiences and meanings of community gardening participants, conducted as part of a social prescribing pilot project targeting elderly residents in Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. The conclusions are as follows:

First, community gardening was confirmed as a foundation for enhancing the psychological and social factors of rural elderly by providing opportunities to share resources, form healthy social networks, and gain further social participation opportunities. Based on these findings, it is necessary to develop and provide community-centered programs or services that incorporate activities familiar to the daily lives of rural elderly.

Second, this study confirmed that even in rural areas, collaboration between community universities and institutions centered around living spaces can create a foundation for elderly participation in gardening activities. It is expected that this research can serve as foundational data for linking health promotion programs or services centered around living spaces within the community in the future.

Third, the community gardening activity, implemented as part of the social prescribing pilot project, can provide foundational data for suggesting ways to utilize 'gardening,' which is included in the Community Integrated Care serviceâ€”a locally-led social service policy currently implemented in South Korea.

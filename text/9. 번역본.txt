A Study on the Social Prescribing for Implementation through the Analysis of International Frameworks

Abstract

(Background and Purpose) Modern societies face complex and multi-dimensional challenges, including aging populations, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, social isolation, and deteriorating mental health. To address these pressing issues, leading nations have strategically adopted design methodologies and integrated interventions to enhance public well-being. The United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Singapore have institutionalized or localized social prescribing models, strategically designing community-integrated care systems based on social determinants of health. This study aims to comprehensively analyze and map social prescribing frameworks in these four countries, comparing them with South Korea’s initiatives to establish a structured foundation for professional implementation.
(Method) This research employs a systematic methodology, utilizing data from official institutional websites, government reports, and academic databases. First, data on social prescribing in each country were systematically collected and categorized. Second, an analytical framework was applied, focusing on key components such as background, operational structure, and linkages with healthcare and welfare systems. Third, mapping techniques were used to visually compare national models, highlighting their unique characteristics and differences. Finally, a comparative analysis of South Korea’s existing social prescribing initiatives was conducted to derive strategic insights for further development, specialization, and institutionalization.
(Result) The findings reveal distinct national approaches to social prescribing. The UK has developed a nationwide framework through institutionalization and deployment of dedicated personnel, facilitating seamless collaboration between healthcare institutions and local communities. Canada’s model emphasizes the utilization of resources at the provincial level, fostering cooperation among medical institutions and social service providers. Japan has implemented a culture and arts-centered approach, integrating museums, hospitals, and parks through collaboration between local communities and universities. Singapore has adopted a healthcare-driven model, where public hospitals and healthcare providers play a central role in linking patients with community-based services. South Korea shares similarities with Japan’s culture and arts-based initiatives but lacks the collaborative systems with the medical and healthcare sectors found in Canada and Singapore.
(Conclusion) Based on these insights, this study presents three key recommendations for advancing social prescribing in South Korea. First, system design should actively incorporate public spaces and community resources such as libraries, museums, and parks to enhance accessibility and engagement. Second, a governance framework should be established to promote collaboration between cultural, healthcare, and social care sectors, ensuring an integrated approach. Third, inter-ministerial cooperation must be strengthened, accompanied by strategic policies for workforce development and capacity-building in social prescribing. Implementing these measures can significantly enhance public services, foster healthier communities, and improve overall societal well-being through effective social prescribing design.

1. Introduction

1.1 Research Background and Purpose

The world stands at a point where efforts for the sustainable life of humanity are increasingly necessary due to complex issues qualitatively different from the past, such as slowing economic and population growth rates, localized wars and abnormal climate changes, infectious disease crises, healthcare burdens from aging populations and chronic diseases, loneliness, isolation, and mental health challenges. Such phenomena are promoting practices aimed at the efficient management and allocation of public goods1), or innovative rearrangement, with goals centered on equity, fairness, and mitigating social disparities, rather than development focused solely on growth.
The multi-dimensional issues faced by advanced societies are not solvable through simple 'problem-solving' approaches. Issues identified as wicked problems necessitate seeking improvement through systematic and holistic design methods. In the context of this societal need, the report 'Design Thinking for Public Service Excellence' (UNDP, 2014) was published internationally early on, specifying holistic methodologies through iterative social experiments and prototypes, and application strategies for the public sector to improve complex issues. Singapore, through its Design 2025 strategy, emphasizes the need for innovative design across education, industry, welfare, and the public sector, and highlights the establishment of collaborative governance among diverse stakeholders to enhance international competitiveness (Design Singapore Council, 2016).
Meanwhile, the UK, seeking to introduce innovative design to reorganize its health and welfare system focused on community care and prevention in response to aging and the increase in chronic diseases, formed an All-Party Parliamentary Group in 2014 (APPGAHW, 2017). Cooperating beyond party interests to improve the UK's health and social care system, they published an evidence-based research report in 2017 addressing holistic approaches and positive effects of arts contributing to health and well-being. This report ultimately influenced the UK NHS's Long Term Plan (2019), becoming a model for institutionalizing collaboration between the cultural/arts and health/welfare sectors, enabling the nationwide expansion of 'social prescribing,' including culture and arts (Khan, & Giurca, 2023).
The UK's social prescribing system has seen more active global dissemination since the WHO shared guidance for its implementation on its website in 2022. Furthermore, Canada, Japan, Singapore, etc., are adopting it, showing a trend towards institutionalization. South Korea also introduced the concept of social prescribing through the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in 2023, conducting pilot operations and launching full-scale projects last year, yet limitations still exist. Therefore, this study aims to conduct foundational research for professional implementation by mapping the social prescribing systems and frameworks of various countries, analyzing them, and comparing them with domestic social prescribing projects.

1.2 Research Scope and Method

This study aims to analyze global social prescribing frameworks and models of various countries. For this purpose, two countries that have pioneered institutionalization, implementation, evaluation, and management (UK, Canada) and two countries in the pilot operation and institutional introduction phase (Japan, Singapore) were selected as subjects. The research scope and methods were planned according to the following steps:
First, systematically collect literature such as research and outcome reports, websites from official government/institutional/organizational sources related to social prescribing in each country, and online academic databases. Second, systematically analyze the collected data using an analytical framework that includes detailed items such as the background of each country's health system and social prescribing introduction, operating entities and methods, social prescribing processes and personnel, overall system characteristics, and national features. Third, based on the analysis results, map the national frameworks and propose the introduction of professional elements optimized for the domestic situation, discussing implications.

2. Theoretical Background

2.1 Definition and Types of Social Prescribing

The concept of Social Prescribing, first institutionalized and implemented in the UK, departs from the traditional patient-centered medical service focused primarily on disease treatment. It involves referring patients to non-clinical community services, utilizing diverse resources such as culture and arts, park walks, sports, volunteering, and housing support. This human-centered approach aims to improve psychosocial health, creatively lower healthcare cost burdens, and enhance the welfare system for health inequality (Kim, & Jung, 2024).

(Figure 2. UK Social Prescribing Type Model (Public Health England website)2) - Assumed to be provided)

The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic threatened social connections and relational safety nets due to social distancing (Choi, Choi, & Kim, 2022), negatively impacting mental health by increasing isolation, depression, loneliness, and apathy. Due to rapid societal changes like unprecedented aging rates and increased chronic diseases, countries worldwide are adopting social prescribing, differentiated from existing welfare projects as a model for community connection and health safety net construction, adapting it to their national contexts, leading to its global spread.
Canada, Japan, Australia, Singapore, etc., are operating social prescribing, while some states in the US are conducting pilot projects. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Brussels, Belgium also piloted social prescribing for six months, linking hospitals with various city museums to support patients' psychological well-being. Recently, Portugal, Northern Ireland, Ireland, and New Zealand in Europe have also introduced and implemented social prescribing (Nogueira, et al., 2023).
Thus, the representative types of international social prescribing can be classified as shown in <Table 1>, including culture & arts, physical activity, green (nature), social connection, practical support, health management & education, etc. (APPGAHW, 2017; NHS England, 2020; WHO, 2022).

(Table 1. Social Prescribing Types (Compiled with reference to NHS examples) - Assumed to be provided)

2.2 International Social Prescribing Implementation Status

The UK, having operated social prescribing the longest and institutionalized it as a health service included in the national social security insurance system, aims for standardized implementation models by building frameworks suited to the resources and environment of each local government. Notably, the Welsh Government's framework3) has implemented social prescribing since 2016 to address social exclusion and health inequalities.
It began in the late 1990s with arts-based mental health promotion programs in Manchester, UK. Subsequently, collaborations with GPs were initiated to promote patient mental health and community solidarity through the arts, evolving into the 'Arts on Prescription' model (Bungay, & Clift, 2010). In the early 2000s, pilot projects for various target groups commenced with support from the NHS (National Health Service, similar to Korea's National Health Insurance) and Arts Council England. Through the 2017 report by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the effectiveness of arts in well-being, arts prescribing gained recognition, leading to the adoption of social prescribing as a major policy in the UK's NHS Long Term Plan in 2019 (NHS England, 2019).
Subsequently, dedicated personnel called Link Workers, connecting community resources with target individuals, were assigned and increasingly employed in social prescribing projects. As they became core personnel within the NHS system, accessing health, medical, personal information, providing counseling, and linking individuals to resources of interest, it provided momentum for the nationwide expansion of the social prescribing system by 2023.
Canada's social prescribing saw the establishment of the Canadian Institute for Social Prescribing (CISP) by the Red Cross in 2022, aiming to achieve the goal of building a national social prescribing network with financial support from the Public Health Agency of Canada (Saragosa, et al., 2024). Canada's first social prescribing initiative began with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts prescription program4) in 2016, where doctors directly issue prescriptions for patients to participate in museum programs, collaborating closely with the museum.5)
In contrast, Ontario's social prescribing adopted the UK model in 2018, modifying it to fit the Canadian system. Thus, it operates through linkage between primary care institutions and community services (Mulligan, et al., 2020). Currently, social prescribing is not officially included in Ontario's health insurance (OHIP), and Canadian social prescribing is characterized by diverse models existing according to the insurance systems and finances of each provincial government.6)
In Japan, the concept of social prescribing was introduced to the Japanese medical academic community starting in 2020, and an office for loneliness and isolation countermeasures was established in the Cabinet in 2021. However, implementation of social prescribing at the prefectural or municipal policy/program level, or within the medical insurance system, is difficult to confirm. Meanwhile, the Tokyo University of the Arts' 'Cultural Prescribing (文化的処方)' project7) currently realizes communication connecting people and society by integrating diverse arts, culture, medicine, welfare, technology, etc., in linkage with the community.
In Singapore, under government support, the SingHealth public hospital cluster, the largest under the Ministry of Health, pioneered the introduction of social prescribing. This model connects patients to hospital-based programs and community resources like arts, exercise, and volunteering, focusing on preventive healthcare management and alleviating social isolation, moving beyond simple disease treatment.

2.3 Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism's 'Culture for Social Solidarity'

Post-Covid-19, South Korea also led projects supporting inclusive and integrated daily life recovery to heal mental health difficulties. Alongside the recognized need for primary care-centered integrated care models for managing the elderly and chronic diseases in 2022, government basic plans addressing mental health were successively announced in 2023, including support for isolated/reclusive youth, prevention of solitary deaths, and mental health policy innovation. This signifies a shift towards preventive policies supported and cared for by the state, rather than solely individual disease management, and a shift in focus towards the community.

(Figure 3. 2023 Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism Social Prescribing Pilot Project Structure - Assumed to be provided)

The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST), aligning with this trend towards community-centered preventive health approaches for mental health, the elderly, and chronic diseases, reviewed the social prescribing system and sought to introduce the concept. Based on the Basic Plan for Cultural Promotion ('23-'27) grounded in Article 8 of the Basic Culture Act, it piloted the development and operation of the 'Connecting Society Regional Hub Program' in 2023, aiming for social connection and relationship recovery. This project selected 5 basic regional areas, operating and managing resource-tailored social prescribing programs. In the 2024 main project, the hub regions were expanded to 9 locations, enhancing the project by expanding resources, structure, types, targets, etc. (Arts Council Korea [ARKO], 2024 - translator note: original text cites KOCPI), however, limitations persist in the operational system for health and welfare linkage.

2.4 Convergent Research on Social Prescribing and Design

Unlike in the past, leading nations are designing creative and innovative processes and implementation strategies through interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration to address complex social issues for healthy communities, as shown in <Table 2>.

(Table 2. Examples of Convergent Research between Health/Welfare Domains and Design - Assumed to be provided)

Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Design Lab (D-Lab) researched creative approaches to transform the existing US healthcare system paradigm. They utilized design methodologies aiming to break down silos between social service agencies and various professional fields and connect them to solve complex healthcare problems (Nogueira, et al., 2023).
The Canadian Institute for Social Prescribing is building a national social prescribing network through co-design methodologies. Diverse stakeholders, including researchers from various institutions, clinicians, community-based organizations, and policymakers, participated in collaboratively developing social prescribing principles and implementation strategies (Saragosa, et al., 2024).
Hongik University's Public Design major in Korea systematically designed a protocol for utilizing existing museum education and event programs for psychosocial health support through culture and arts. Based on these research results, a quasi-experimental study was conducted in collaboration with universities and art museums within Gyeonggi Province. This validated short-term intervention effects and proposed the establishment of clinical evidence and appropriate tool utilization from the initial design stages.9)
Sweden's University of Gothenburg's Centre for Ageing and Health introduced co-creation methods from art and design workshops into the welfare system context. Accordingly, the university's Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and Academy of Design and Crafts collaborated to research practical guidelines for improving elderly care facility environments (Wikström, et al., 2024).

3. Analysis of National Social Prescribing Introduction and Operational Systems

3.1 Research Subjects

This study researched cases and literature from leading countries implementing social prescribing to institutionalize it. Accordingly, the social prescribing systems of four major implementing countries - UK, Canada, Japan, and Singapore - were selected as the subjects of this study, as shown in <Figure 4>.

(Figure 4. Subjects of this study: 4 Countries Implementing Social Prescribing - Assumed to be provided)

3.2 Research Method

The research method involved collecting relevant data from official institutional, governmental, and collaborating organizational websites, research reports, project outcomes, press releases, and online academic databases of the four countries implementing social prescribing. The data collection period was from January 2023 to January 2025. The collected data were systematically analyzed using the analysis framework shown in <Table 3>. Subsequently, the analysis results for each country were synthesized, and the main implementation systems and structures of social prescribing in the leading countries were visualized using mapping methodology10). Finally, the mapped national social prescribing frameworks were comparatively analyzed with the domestic social prescribing project framework to discuss characteristics and implications for introducing social prescribing in Korea.

(Table 3. Research Analysis Framework - Assumed to be provided)

3.3 Characteristics of Social Prescribing System Introduction by Leading Countries

3.3.1 United Kingdom
The UK NHS's General Practitioner (GP) system is a primary means of supporting individual health management, but workforce shortages and high demand lead to long waiting times for appointments in some regions. Consequently, GP workload increases, limiting effective responses to the social isolation and emotional problems of chronic disease patients and the elderly. Furthermore, the traditional hospital-centric treatment approach focuses on acute and chronic disease management but faces difficulties in preventive care and improving quality of life. To supplement this, social prescribing was introduced, utilizing community resources to support health and well-being. Social prescribing connects patients to appropriate community activities and services, and has reported effects in reducing healthcare cost burdens (e.g., medication costs, hospitalization fees).12)

3.3.2 Canada
Canada operates different healthcare systems across its 10 provinces and 3 territories. Provincial governments design and manage healthcare services, while the federal government provides financial support and ensures universal accessibility, although social prescribing is not included. Ontario's Alliance for Healthier Communities (AHC) introduced a social prescribing pilot program in 2018, providing non-medical support through Community Health Centres (CHCs). Additionally, Montreal, Quebec, has implemented the 'Museum Prescription' since 2016, offering participation in museum programs to support mental well-being. In 2022, the Canadian Red Cross established the Canadian Institute for Social Prescribing (CISP) to promote the institutionalization of social prescribing through nationally supported research and linking community resources. Recent research utilizes co-design methods from service design to strengthen community collaboration structures.

3.3.3 Japan
Tokyo University of the Arts, in collaboration with the private company Concent, Inc., introduced the concept of social prescribing in 2022 by establishing a pilot community center. This institution sought creative solutions to social isolation by integrating arts and technology and linking with the community. An international forum was held in 2023 to share global trends and Japanese cases on the theme of social prescribing. As a result, efforts are underway to build a platform integrating arts, welfare, medicine, and technology, strengthening community cooperation towards 2030. While direct linkage with medical insurance has not occurred, the establishment of a ministerial post for loneliness and isolation countermeasures in 2018 indicates a gradual expansion of budgets related to social prescribing.

3.3.4 Singapore
Under government support, the SingHealth public healthcare cluster, equipped with a mixed healthcare system, introduced a social prescribing program in 2019. This model aims to address the complex health and social needs of the aging population, moving beyond simple disease treatment. It focuses on preventive health management and alleviating social isolation by linking public hospital services with the community.

3.4 Comprehensive Analysis of National Social Prescribing Systems

(Table 4. Summary Analysis of Operational Systems in 4 Representative Social Prescribing Implementing Countries - Assumed to be provided)

4. Comparison of Frameworks from 4 Major Countries, Analysis, and Implications for Professional Implementation

4.1 Mapping National Social Prescribing Frameworks by Country
The concept of mapping applied in this study utilized the following two domains. First, reference was made to the Capacity Mapping Tool (WHO, 2010) shared on the WHO website as a method for evaluating national health promotion capacity. Relevant items include health and welfare-related policies and plans, collaboration mechanisms within government and local authorities, program operational structures, NGOs, private-government partnerships, professional workforce, health financing, and systems. Second, in service design methodology, mapping involves transforming complex information, relationships, flows, processes, etc., into visual information diagrams to identify key operational processes and facilitate communication. The data required for mapping are broadly divided into two categories as shown in <Table 5>: objective data and subjective data. Subjective data are utilized when analyzing and organizing various collected objective information and converting it into visual information.

(Table 5. Mapping Classification and Process13) - Assumed to be provided)

The social prescribing operational systems of the four major countries were comprehensively analyzed and organized using the analysis framework mentioned earlier. Based on this, the national social prescribing frameworks were visualized as clear diagrams from <Figure 5> to <Figure 8> to visually represent intangible aspects like collaboration networks, funding and support institutions, relationships, affiliations, service structures and procedures, delivery systems, etc., and to identify comparative groups for domestic introduction.

(Figure 5. UK Social Prescribing Framework - Assumed to be provided)
(Figure 6. Canada Social Prescribing Framework - Assumed to be provided)
(Figure 7. Singapore Social Prescribing Framework - Assumed to be provided)
(Figure 8. Japan Social Prescribing Framework - Assumed to be provided)

4.2 Mapping and Analysis of Domestic Social Prescribing Project System

(Figure 9. Domestic Social Prescribing Project Framework - Assumed to be provided)

The domestic social prescribing system was mapped as shown in <Figure 9>, referencing the 2024 MCST 'Culture for Social Solidarity' project outcome report (Arts Council Korea [ARKO], 2024 - translator note: original text cites KOCPI). A characteristic feature of the domestic system is its aim towards a structure where commissioned operating institutions designate hub centers like cultural foundations and university industry-academic cooperation groups across national regions, linking them to diverse community resources. This has the advantage of potentially activating a dense network of local places, environments, resources, personnel, etc., for cultural arts welfare services. Activation of community resources mobilized under the objective of preventing isolation and loneliness through non-intrusive culture and arts emerged as both the goal and characteristic of the domestic social prescribing project.
However, the social prescribing project structure analyzed in this study shows little evidence of support from or collaboration with the Korean health insurance system, which has maintained a unified medical supply system involving public-private cooperation since the 2000s. Furthermore, the single-year commissioned project operation method raises concerns about hindering the stability and sustainability of providing qualitative and professional public services. Additionally, specific details regarding securing specialized personnel, systematic operational systems, budget allocation and execution, etc., were not identified through the report, suggesting it corresponds to the initial introductory phase of a first-time policy project. Therefore, this study necessitates enhancing concrete and strategic implementation directions.

4.3 Comparative Results of International Social Prescribing Framework Comprehensive Evaluation and Implications

(Table 6. Evaluation Results of Domestic and International Social Prescribing Frameworks - Assumed to be provided)

The results of comprehensively analyzing the internationally implemented social prescribing frameworks by country and comparing them with the domestic situation through this study are as follows.

First, the social prescribing frameworks of Korea and Japan exhibit similar structural characteristics compared to other countries. This is primarily due to the operation centered around existing internal personnel within institutions without hiring separate specialized staff, and the insufficient linkage with medical insurance. While both countries utilize cultural and arts resources, Japan is characterized by actively utilizing diverse public spaces and capabilities such as national museums, children's hospitals, music halls, and libraries. Furthermore, considering Korea's early project stage, it is necessary to refer to Japan's strategies for platform development, promotion, and participant recruitment to enhance public awareness and participation rates. Thus, maximizing the utilization of institutions with existing capabilities and strengthening linkages with private enterprises and academic research will be crucial strategies for enhancing project effectiveness in the future.

Second, countries with healthcare institution linkage as a foundation are successfully implementing the specialization and institutionalization of social prescribing. Unlike Japan and Korea, Singapore supports budgets through a Ministry of Health-led public healthcare system and has a structure directly linking patients needing community care with specialized personnel. Such a system plays a role in actively identifying vulnerable groups and strengthening collaborative and professional capabilities by linking them to diverse public environments. Additionally, Canada implements social prescribing in collaboration with provincial medical associations, operating inclusive and comprehensive models targeting chronic diseases, disabilities, the elderly, immigrant families, etc., in Montreal province. Therefore, gradual medical linkage strategies should be considered to prevent the exclusion of specific target groups and ensure multi-layered inclusion in social prescribing participation.

Third, countries where social prescribing is institutionally established are characterized by high evaluation scores and continuous, stable operation. To achieve this, strengthening professional inter-ministerial cooperation beyond the current lead ministry (MCST) is necessary. Particularly, introducing strategic implementation measures such as establishing institutional and policy support systems and providing conversion training for existing specialized personnel or fostering new ones is required. This suggests the need to secure the sustainability of social prescribing and develop it into a more systematic public service model.

5. Conclusion

The role of modern design is expanding towards policy, institutions, and community support for solving social problems and complex challenges. From this public service design perspective, systematic design approaches are becoming increasingly integrated with major universities and welfare systems in developed countries.
Reflecting this timeliness of design, this study sought professional and systematic implementation strategies for domestic social prescribing. To this end, the social prescribing frameworks of leading countries were mapped, compared, and analyzed, deriving implications for domestic application based on these findings. Particularly, beyond framework mapping, it was suggested that referencing Japan's strategies, given similarities in East Asian culture, healthcare insurance systems, and aging demographics, and Canada's collaborative model actively utilizing regional healthcare systems and cultural/arts resources, is necessary. Furthermore, it is proposed that meticulously investigating Korea's community cultural arts infrastructure, demographic structure, and health insurance system, and exploring linkage possibilities with primary care institutions and public health centers, is essential.
Future research is expected to expand towards designing more specific protocols and strategic implementation systems, establishing policy support and multilateral collaborative frameworks based on empirical research, thereby advancing social prescribing design research.

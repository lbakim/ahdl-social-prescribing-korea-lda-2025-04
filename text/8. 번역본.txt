Comparison of Social Prescribing Pilot Project Using Capacity Mapping Tool: The Case Study of Wonju, South Korea and Ontario, Canada

Abstract
Social prescribing is utilized as a policy by the UK government, particularly the Ministry of Loneliness, to address loneliness among the elderly. Canada has also introduced and is operating social prescribing in the form of a pilot project in the province of Ontario. In Korea, a university has developed a pilot project targeting rural areas and is currently implementing a social prescribing pilot for lonely elderly individuals aged 65 and over. This study attempted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each project by comparing these two pilot cases. Using a capacity mapping tool for analysis, the following conclusions were drawn. First, Korea's initiative was a university-level pilot project, not yet an official public sector social prescribing system, whereas Canada operated its pilot project utilizing public health center organizations. Specifically, the Korean pilot project was developed and operated by a university research center using national research funds and the university's LINC project budget, while the Canadian project was operated in 11 public health centers funded by the provincial government budget. Second, both countries were training volunteers by utilizing experienced individuals who had previously undergone social prescribing to assist in subsequent programs. Korea fostered them under the name 'Village Mentor (Maeul Hunjang),' while Canada devised and utilized a 'Health Champion' system. Third, regarding the type of social prescribing programs, both cases applied compounded prescriptions rather than single prescriptions. That is, various social prescribing programs were offered, indicating a need for standardization of these programs. Fourth, the implementation of social prescribing programs confirmed improvements in participants' loneliness, depression, social connection, self-efficacy, and self-esteem, with both countries showing effectiveness in reducing loneliness. Fifth, concerning income generation linked to the project for low-income elderly participants, Korea utilized proceeds from selling handmade COVID-19 hygiene products and harvested fruits/vegetables from gardening activities as living support funds for the elderly participants.
In conclusion, based on the comparison, the need for institutional introduction of a national-level social prescribing project in Korea was raised. Leadership from the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the National Health Insurance Corporation is required for identifying existing social prescribing-related resources and commercializing the project through consultation with the medical community.

I. Introduction

Loneliness, which leads to various mental health problems, increased suicide rates, and solitary deaths, is becoming a social issue, emerging as a public health problem in major developed countries like the UK, Canada, and Korea. A recent issue of the UK's Guardian newspaper reported that since March 2020, over 700 people in London alone died at home, not in hospitals or nursing homes (The Guardian, 2020.06.08).

The UK Minister for Loneliness designated loneliness as a social problem to be addressed and officially announced the policy promotion of social prescribing as part of the loneliness strategy in 2018 (Savage et al., 2020). Subsequently, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) introduced the social prescribing system utilizing UK General Practitioners (GPs) (Nam Eun-woo, 2020a). Since then, 84 quantitative and qualitative papers on social prescribing have been published in the UK alone (based on PubMed search from 2018.01-2020.08). Following this, Canada, a member of the Commonwealth, also introduced and operated the social prescribing system in the form of a pilot project. This project was operated in parts of Ontario, the province where Canada's capital, Toronto, is located. As a result, the 'Final Report on Social Prescribing in Ontario' was published in March 2020 (AHC, 2020).

According to the King's Fund (2017), social prescribing is a concept where doctors and primary healthcare professionals refer patients to broader non-clinical services to manage patients concurrently with clinical treatment (Bickerdike et al., 2017; Kings Fund, 2017). Furthermore, social prescribing is a result of economic, environmental, and social factors, and takes a holistic approach when providing healthcare services (The Kings Fund, 2017).

Academic evidence for social prescribing also exists. A systematic review that systematically screened 7,676 documents and finally reviewed 16 concluded that social prescribing resulted in positive adjustments in physical indicators (reduction in blood pressure, weight, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels), health-related behavior indicators (increase in physical activity, decrease in alcohol consumption, prescription drugs, unhealthy diet), mental health indicators (increase in self-reliance, self-esteem, confidence), social interaction indicators (decrease in isolation, loneliness), and daily living function indicators (improvement in cognitive function, desire for work, return to work after illness or accident, motivation, receiving help from social prescribing).

Japan is also reviewing and reflecting social prescribing in its policies as one of the policy alternatives for improving cognitive function in dementia patients. According to a policy report from the Health and Global Policy Institute under the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, policies such as developing mechanisms for resident participation and supporting the establishment of dementia cafes to improve the independence and social capital of local elderly are beginning to be reviewed as social prescribing (Nam Eun-woo et al. trans., 2020).

The Alliance for Healthier Communities (AHC, 2020), which implemented and evaluated the Canadian pilot project, emphasizes the importance of social prescribing, viewing 80-90% of health determinants as originating from social determinants of health (AHC, 2020). That is, for health and well-being, it is crucial to have a sense of belonging through meaningful activities for the individual, alongside clinical treatment. Ontario's social prescribing was implemented in 11 community health centres (CHCs) and consists of five core elements: ① service user ② social prescriber ③ navigator ④ social prescription ⑤ data sharing. The analysis results of this Canadian social prescribing pilot project could provide significant implications for the development and operation of the Wonju Heungeup-myeon social prescribing project currently being piloted by the Healthy City Research Center at Yonsei University, with financial support from the National Research Foundation of Korea and Yonsei University's LINC project group.

A widely used tool for evaluating health promotion projects like social prescribing is the capacity mapping tool developed by the WHO. Mapping is a foundational process for intervention research aimed at capacity building and serves as a means to effectively monitor and evaluate various events occurring during research implementation (LaFond 2002). Additionally, utilizing the capacity mapping tool allows for the identification of existing resources and capacity needs. However, as there is no standard, optimized method for capacity mapping, it needs to be improved and utilized appropriately according to the researcher and project capacity (Mittelmark et al. 2006).

This study aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the social prescribing project being implemented in Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do by comparing it with an overseas case from Canada. To achieve this, it will first, compare the types of social prescribing; second, compare the main activity contents of social prescribing; third, compare the promotion and communication methods of the social prescribing project; fourth, compare the evaluation systems and indicators related to the project; and fifth, compare and analyze income generation.

II. Methods

1. Study Areas

To achieve the research objectives, the Korean case study site is the social prescribing pilot project being implemented in Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do by the Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center. The Canadian case study site is the social prescribing pilot project being implemented in the province of Ontario <Figure 1>, <Figure 2>.

(Figure 1. Korean Pilot Project Area - Wonju-si Heungeup-myeon: 1 Area - Assumed to be provided)
(Figure 2. Canadian Pilot Project Area - Ontario Province: 11 Areas - Assumed to be provided)

2. Analysis Tool

The analysis tool used to achieve the research objectives was the capacity mapping tool developed by the WHO (2010) for general monitoring and evaluation of health promotion projects. (https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/116633).

This study evaluated and compared the social prescribing projects in Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Korea, and Ontario, Canada. The evaluation items based on the Capacity Mapping Tool consisted of ① Population and Geography ② Relevant Literature, Policies, Laws & Regulations ③ Elements of Social Prescribing ④ Promotion and Communication ⑤ Evaluation System and Indicators ⑥ Resources, Budget, and Income Generation Status ⑦ COVID-19 Preparedness, Prevention, and Healthcare Activities. A literature review of relevant academic papers and reports was conducted to evaluate each item. The literature review was based on Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, and the WHO webpage.

3. Data Collection and Analysis

The data collection period for this study was from May 2018 to July 2020. Korean data were comparatively surveyed focusing on social prescribing-related papers and manuals. Canadian data were comparatively analyzed using the Capacity Mapping Tool, primarily based on the final report of the Canadian social prescribing pilot project prepared by the Alliance for Healthier Communities (AHC), titled 'Social Prescribing in Ontario Final Report' (2020).

III. Research Results

1. Geographic and Demographic Status of Study Areas

The geographic and demographic status of the domestic social prescribing case (Wonju) and the Ontario, Canada case are presented in <Table 1>.

(Table 1. Geographic and Demographic Status by Study Area - Assumed to be provided)

2. Literature, Policies, and Regulations Related to Social Prescribing in Each Study Area

Regarding domestic social prescribing literature, there is one paper from 2019 and one guideline from 2020. Both documents describe the social prescribing initiative conducted by the Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center, targeting lonely elderly aged 65 and over residing in Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do, with financial support from the National Research Foundation of Korea and the Yonsei University Mirae Campus LINC project group.
The paper published in 2019 (Song Geu-reum et al., 2019) presented a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the effects of a 4-week social prescribing project. The guideline published in 2020 (Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center, 2020) introduced the theoretical background of Music Storytelling implemented as part of social prescribing and the methods for conducting the social prescribing program.

Regarding Canadian social prescribing literature, there is one report and two papers from 2020. The final report published by the province of Ontario (Alliance for Healthier Communities, 2020) introduced the entirety of Canada's first social prescribing project, implemented in 11 community health centres (CHCs) under the auspices of the Alliance for Healthier Communities with financial support from Health Canada. It detailed the background for introducing social prescribing, ① factors enabling successful program execution, ② core elements of social prescribing operation, ③ operating bodies and their respective roles, and ④ the content of social prescribing implemented at the 11 CHCs.
Kate Mulligan and researchers (2020) introduced the background and results of the Ontario social prescribing pilot project, arguing for the potential of social prescribing to enable the innovation pursued by Western medical systems. Savage and researchers (2020) also confirmed the potential of social prescribing to complement clinical treatment for loneliness among the elderly. However, Savage et al. (2020) argued that to maximize the benefits of social prescribing and minimize unintended risks, more evaluation is needed to secure evidence, requiring further investment.

(Table 3. Social Prescribing Related Literature in Ontario, Canada - Assumed to be provided)

3. Elements of Social Prescribing in Each Study Area (Content and Personnel)

1) Project Goals
The domestic social prescribing case aimed to enhance elderly self-esteem and mental health, and promote active social participation, targeting lonely elderly aged 65 and over residing in Heungeup-myeon. The Canadian case aimed to improve mental health (loneliness, depression) and sense of community belonging through non-clinical support, targeting middle-aged and older adults experiencing mental illness and chronic conditions. (Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center 2020; AHC 2020)

2) Implementing and Collaborating Institutions
Implementing and collaborating institutions in the domestic case were led by Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center, involving 5 organizations: Yonsei University LINC Project Group (Industry-Academic Cooperation Foundation), Heungeup-myeon Small Library, Heungeup-myeon Public Health Subcenter, Heungeup-myeon Administrative Welfare Center, and Wonju Agricultural Technology Center. In the Canadian case, led by the Alliance for Healthier Communities, there were 11 CHCs and various community partner organizations (medical, arts, culture, social services). (Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center 2020; AHC 2020)

(Figure 3. Social Prescribing Model in Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do - Assumed to be provided)

3) Implementers
Implementers in the domestic case consisted of Music Storytelling instructors, cultural and arts experts from various fields, and community volunteers. In the Canadian case, implementers included social prescribers (medical staff, dietitians, occupational therapists, social workers, etc.), Health Champions, and community volunteers. (Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center, 2020; AHC, 2020)

4) Location
Implementation locations for the domestic case were 4 types of institutions: Heungeup-myeon senior centers (Gyeongro-dang), community welfare centers within local apartment complexes, Wonju Agricultural Technology Center, and Heungeup-myeon Small Library. The Canadian case was implemented centered around 11 CHCs across Ontario. (Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center, 2020; AHC, 2020)

5) Types
Types of social prescriptions implemented domestically included 14 activities such as music therapy/Music Storytelling, singing classes, horticultural therapy, cooking, COVID mask making, doll making, and village improvement. Social prescriptions implemented in Canada included 18 programs such as exercise, social activities, cultural/arts activities, and nature activities. (Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center, 2020; AHC, 2020)

(Table 4. Social Prescribing Programs by Study Area - Assumed to be provided)

6) Involvement of Healthcare Professionals (Physicians)
In Ontario, Canada, physicians acted as social prescribers, diagnosing/evaluating patients and implementing social prescriptions. In Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, public health doctors did not participate in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pilot projects, but participated from the 4th pilot project onwards, conducting social prescribing programs and performing pre-post physical and depression diagnostic evaluations.

7) Personnel Structure and Roles
Both Ontario, Canada, and Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, involved social prescribers, navigators, and physicians in implementing social prescribing programs. First, in Heungeup-myeon, the lead Link Worker acted as the social prescriber, overseeing the MST (Music Story Telling) program, identifying and coordinating community resources, and conducting the MST program <Table 5>. In Ontario, Canada, social prescriptions were primarily issued by physicians or nurses based on their assessment of the patient's health status.
Regarding the navigator role, in Heungeup-myeon, navigators handled MST program guidance and promotion, program surveys and observation, report writing, budget management, and self-help group intervention. In Ontario, navigators were responsible for patient matching and community-based support roles.
In Heungeup-myeon, physicians participated from the 4th pilot project onwards, performing pre-post physical and depression diagnosis/evaluation related to the MST program implementation. In Ontario, physicians and nurses played the role of identifying patients' health status, referring them for social prescriptions, and providing diagnoses.

8) Utilization of Experienced Social Prescribing Recipients
An interesting point is that both social prescribing cases utilized 'participants with prior experience.' In the domestic case, elderly individuals who attended every session, completed the program, and received a graduation certificate were given the title 'Village Mentor (Maeul Hunjang)' to encourage active participation from subsequent program attendees. Similarly, the Canadian case devised and utilized a 'Health Champion' system, where participants with prior experience of receiving social prescriptions facilitated the overall program for other participants as part of volunteer activities.

(Table 5. Personnel Structure and Roles in Social Prescribing by Study Area - Assumed to be provided)

4. Social Prescribing Promotion and Communication in Each Study Area

Both the Korean and Ontario, Canada social prescribing initiatives utilized mass media as a communication strategy. The domestic social prescribing used two types of media: internet articles and local newspapers. In contrast, the Canadian social prescribing utilized diverse media including internet articles, local newspapers, TV/radio broadcasts, and social media pages of collaborating organizations (e.g., Facebook). Additionally, Ontario, Canada continuously shared pilot project operational status and 'Open Source' materials through the websites of the lead organization, Alliance for Healthier Communities, and the 11 implementing CHCs <Table 6>.

(Table 6. Social Prescribing Promotion and Communication by Study Area - Assumed to be provided)

5. Social Prescribing Evaluation Indicators

The Heungeup social prescribing project consisted of 4 phases from July 2019 to July 2020, with each phase lasting 8-11 weeks. Evaluations were conducted twice (pre and post) to assess the changes in each evaluation indicator score. The Canadian case was implemented over approximately one year from May 2018 to March 2019, with three evaluation points/data collections, allowing for comparison of indicator scores at pre, mid, and post stages.
The evaluation indicators for the Heungeup case were five: self-efficacy, self-esteem, depression, loneliness, and attitude towards social activity participation. The Ontario case had four: subjective mental health, loneliness, social support, sense of belonging, and social connectivity. Among these, loneliness was a common evaluation indicator. Similar indicators included attitude towards social activity participation (Korea) and sense of belonging/social connectivity (Canada) <Table 7>.

(Table 7. Social Prescribing Evaluation Content and Indicators by Study Area - Assumed to be provided)

6. Income Generation through Social Prescribing

The Heungeup-myeon social prescribing income generation program was conducted through collaborating institutions including the Community Care Youth Volunteer Group, an agricultural cooperative, and local community stores. Conversely, the Ontario social prescribing program did not currently involve income generation activities. The types of income generation programs in the Heungeup-myeon pilot project involved making and selling handmade COVID-19 masks and selling harvested produce like tomatoes, corn, and sweet potatoes from gardening activities. Sales locations for the Heungeup program included four venues: a local food zone, flea markets, collaborating community stores, and self-service stalls. The current income generated from the Heungeup program is approximately 500,000 KRW. The generated income is planned to be used for supporting the living expenses of local lonely elderly individuals. Thus, the gardening activity, implemented as part of the social program, yielded additional economic benefits <Table 8>.

(Table 8. Income Generation Program Status by Study Area - Assumed to be provided)

7. Social Prescribing and COVID-19 Preparedness, Prevention, and Healthcare Activity Status

1) Current Status
As of August 20, 2020, the COVID-19 status in Heungeup-myeon was: 1 total case, 1 recovered, 0 deaths, 0 hospitalizations, 0 ICU admissions, 0 ventilator use. The status in Ontario, Canada was: 40,972 total cases, 37,215 recovered, 2,792 deaths, 42 hospitalizations, 15 ICU admissions, 10 ventilator use.

2) Prevention Activities
COVID-19 prevention activities in Heungeup-myeon included basic spread prevention measures (social distancing, mandatory mask-wearing, providing COVID-19 information, providing self-quarantine guidelines) and disinfection activities conducted 2-3 times per week. Management of vulnerable groups (foreign workers, homeless) was strengthened. Prevention activities in Ontario included providing and verifying COVID-19 information, self-monitoring and self-quarantine guidelines, and operating infection control and confirmed case reporting networks.

3) Social Prescribing Activities During COVID-19
Social prescribing activities in Heungeup-myeon during COVID-19 included non-face-to-face phone consultations, delivery of social prescribing support boxes, providing small tasks through peer groups (e.g., making scrubbies, masks), and holding small 'COVID cheering' concerts. Activities in Ontario included CHC healthcare providers maintaining social prescribing referrals as needed, follow-up via phone and appointments by social prescribing navigators, and non-face-to-face contact between CHC community program staff, volunteers, and participants.

4) COVID-19 Social Welfare Support
Social welfare support in Heungeup-myeon during COVID-19 included temporary school closures and childcare support, emergency disaster relief funds and employment stabilization support, emergency support funds for small business owners, diagnostic test cost support and quarantine treatment cost support, support for vulnerable groups, and psychological counseling services for citizens needing mental care due to COVID-19. Support in Ontario included emergency financial assistance, utility bill and rent support, operation of shelters and food banks for vulnerable groups, interest/penalty relief and utility bill/rent support for business owners, emergency leave and rights protection measures for workers, temporary school closure/childcare support and homeschooling support <Table 9>.

(Table 9. COVID-19 Preparedness, Prevention, and Healthcare Activities by Study Area - Assumed to be provided)

IV. Discussion

This study utilized the capacity mapping tool to examine the population/geographic status, literature/policy/regulations, social prescribing content, personnel structure, promotion & communication strategies, evaluation content & indicators, and budget & income generation status of each study area. The results revealed the following commonalities between the Korean and Canadian social prescribing cases. First, both regions implemented social prescribing involving physician referrals and support activities by navigators. In Wonju Heung-eup, referrals were made by public health doctors at the health subcenter, while in Canada, GPs at community health centers made referrals. Coordination and facilitation between medical staff and community resources by navigators or link workers are reported as crucial success factors in the social prescribing system (ACH 2020; Savage et al. 2020). Notably, the UK announced plans to train 1,000 link workers by the 2020/21 fiscal year to refer 900,000 individuals for social prescribing by 2024 (NHS 2019), suggesting a need for systematic link worker training in Korea to provide quality social prescribing services. Second, regarding research related to social prescribing, Korea had two published domestic research papers and one manual, while Canada had two research papers and one report, indicating research activity on social prescribing in both countries. Third, concerning the type of social prescribing, both cases applied compounded prescriptions rather than single prescriptions for social activities. Medicine defines compounded prescription as simultaneously administering two or more drugs to treat a single symptom or disease, or to treat different diseases concurrently (National Digital Science Library, 2008). Applying this to social prescribing activities, both countries provided participants with two or more diverse social programs. In the future, it may be necessary to first implement single prescriptions to establish scientific evidence for specific programs. That is, clarifying the dose-response relationship and temporal sequence of social prescribing effects through RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials), cohort studies, or case-control studies might be necessary. Fifth, both regions engaged in promotion and communication activities, striving for community dissemination of the project. Both the Wonju Heung-eup and Ontario cases utilized mass media such as the internet and local newspapers for promotion and communication, thereby increasing community awareness of social prescribing. Sixth, among evaluation indicators, both regions showed effectiveness in reducing loneliness, aligning with the goal of social prescribing. Additionally, considering that depression prevalence is high not only among the elderly but also among adolescents (377 individuals) in Wonju (especially female adolescents) (Houri et al, 2012), there might be a need to implement diversified social prescribing tailored to different genders and age groups.

Next, analyzing the Korean and Canadian social prescribing cases revealed several differences. First, Korea's social prescribing was developed and implemented at the township level (Heung-eup-myeon) by a single university research center, whereas Canada's activities occurred at the provincial level across 11 community health centers, indicating a difference in scale. Second, Canada implemented approximately 18 diverse social prescribing programs per CHC, while Korea had about 14 activities linked to MST, such as individual MST sessions, storybook making, singing classes, small concerts, and self-help groups. While qualitative analysis results suggest that adopting a holistic approach and implementing diverse programs increases the effectiveness of social prescribing (Kings Fund 2017), establishing quantitative evidence requires initially implementing single programs in controlled environments. Scientific development of social prescribing programs where dose-response distinctions for each theme are feasible is necessary. Third, examining the personnel structure in each study area, while both countries utilized physicians, social prescribers, navigators, and experienced participants, the professional backgrounds of navigators seemed to differ, and the titles given to experienced participants varied. Also, Heung-eup used the term 'link worker,' whereas Canada used 'navigator.' These terms are often used interchangeably across countries and literature. The social prescriber – who implements social prescribing – is called by various names such as social prescribing link worker, community navigator, community health worker, wellbeing advisor, community agent, community connector, health advisor, etc. (Kang Mi-hwa 2020). The social prescriber connects patients, via social prescribing referrals, to experts and services that can meet their needs. Therefore, while the titles link worker and navigator differ, their roles appear largely similar. Fourth, both countries utilized human resources with prior experience in social prescribing to assist subsequent programs. This was termed 'Village Mentor (Maeul Hunjang)' domestically, while Canada devised and utilized a 'Health Champion' system. Furthermore, the use of volunteers in personnel operation in both countries is thought to contribute to community empowerment (Yonsei Healthy City Research Center 2020; AHC 2020). Fifth, the domestic case did not utilize a website for social prescribing promotion and communication, whereas Canada did. Both countries used internet articles and local newspapers, with Ontario additionally utilizing TV, radio broadcasts, and social media of collaborating organizations. Ontario also continuously shared reports and operational status through AHC and CHC websites. Sixth, both countries used quantitative evaluation indicators. Except for loneliness and social activity-related indicators (Korea: attitude towards social activity participation; Canada: social support, sense of belonging, social connectivity), the remaining indicators differed. Social activity-related indicators were considered similar as they all assessed social activity. Korea measured depression, self-efficacy, and self-esteem, which differed from Canada. Canada quantified subjective mental health and frequency of healthcare visits, which was different. Seventh, regarding funding sources, the Korean project was operated by a university-affiliated small library in a nearby rural area, funded by government research grants (National Research Foundation) and LINC project funds obtained by the university. In contrast, the Canadian project operated as part of a national initiative in 11 CHCs funded by national resources, indicating Canada's larger scale. Additionally, income generation occurred in the domestic case; to generate income linked to the project for participants, handmade COVID-19 hygiene products were produced and sold, and proceeds from selling harvested fruits from gardening were used as living support funds for elderly participants.

A systematic review paper aiming to scientize social prescribing programs stated the need to improve the quality of social prescribing research while utilizing standardized evaluation indicators (Pescheny et al. 2019). Furthermore, evaluation tools used often varied across social prescribing studies, hindering smooth quantitative comparison between studies. This implies potential difficulty in presenting evidence for the efficacy of social prescribing using widely applied evidence-based approaches like meta-analysis. To address this, conducting prior literature reviews and utilizing frequently used or standardized evaluation indicators to quantitatively evaluate social prescribing would be a valid strategy.

V. Conclusion and Suggestions

1. Conclusion

Using the Capacity Mapping Tool to understand the social prescribing pilot project cases in Korea and Canada, analysis of the social prescribing system, programs, evaluation methods, etc., in both countries yielded the following conclusions.
First, Korea's initiative was a university-level pilot project, not yet an official public sector social prescribing system, whereas Canada operated its pilot project utilizing public health center organizations. The Korean pilot project was developed and operated by a university using national research funds and LINC project budgets, while the Canadian project operated in 11 public health centers funded by provincial government budgets.
Second, both countries trained volunteers by utilizing experienced individuals who had previously undergone social prescribing to assist in subsequent programs. Korea fostered them under the name 'Village Mentor,' while Canada devised and utilized a 'Health Champion' system.
Third, regarding the type of social prescribing programs, both cases applied compounded prescriptions rather than single prescriptions. That is, various social prescribing programs were offered, indicating a need for standardization.
Fourth, the implementation of social prescribing programs confirmed improvements in participants' social connection and self-efficacy, with both countries showing effectiveness in reducing depression and loneliness.
Fifth, concerning income generation linked to the project for participants, Korea utilized proceeds from selling handmade COVID-19 hygiene products and harvested fruits from gardening as living support funds for elderly participants.

2. Suggestions

Comparative investigation of Canadian and Korean social prescribing revealed that Canada has already conducted social prescribing pilots through 11 public health center organizations and is considering expansion to other regions. In contrast, Korea's initiative remains a university-level pilot project, not yet a national-level project, highlighting the need for development and operation as a project under the Ministry of Health and Welfare or the National Health Insurance Corporation in the near future (Nam Eun-woo, 2020b). To achieve this, expansion of the current pilot project is necessary, along with surveying local resources capable of operating social prescribing programs and building capacity in preparation for future commercialization of social prescribing.

Ministry of Loneliness in England is implementing social prescribing to tackle increasing loneliness nationwide. Also, a social prescribing pilot study was completed in Ontario, Canada. A university in South Korea developed social prescribing scheme targeting lonely elderly population (age>65) in a rural area. We aimed to compare and analyze similarities and differences of social prescribing in Heung-up, South Korea and Ontario, Canada by seven dimensions using capacity mapping tool.

The result of study is as following. First, social prescribing developed by a university in South Korea remains non-public scheme; whereas, Canadian case is state-wide scheme implemented by community health centers. Second, both cases selected compounded prescriptions making it difficult to determine which program is responsible for which result. Third, both countries utilized experienced ‘social prescribee’ to facilitate the ongoing and future social prescribing program. In Korea, the prescribees were called ‘hunjang’, which means village teacher; in Canada, a very similar system was established as ‘health champion’. Fourth, psychological and social interaction indexes (loneliness, depression, social connectivity, self-efficacy, and etc.) were improved as the outcome of social prescribing in both countries. Fifth, Canada used various communication tools including a webpage with continuous updates while Korea used the news as main communication tool. Sixth, Korea raised funds by producing and selling hand-made COVID-19 masks and dolls; and vegetables and fruits from community farming facility. Seventh, both countries considered preventive measures for COVID-19 preparedness by social distancing, sterilization, and conducting untact social prescribing.

In conclusion, both South Korean and Canadian cases presented strengths and challenges for the social prescribing scheme. To institutionalize and develop the social prescribing city or province-wide scheme, South Korea may learn from Canadian large-scale intervention. Also, the leadership of MOH(Ministry of Health) and NHIC(National Health Insurance Corporation) is important to mobilize existing community resources and to propel the social prescribing scheme by cooperating with the medical sector.

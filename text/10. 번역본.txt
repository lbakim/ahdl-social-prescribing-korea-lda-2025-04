A Study on Realization Methodology of Community Public Value in Social Prescribing and Design Project

Abstract

(Background and Purpose) The World Health Organization recently published ‘A Toolkit on How to Implement Social Prescribing’, a community health promotion policy deemed crucial in the post COVID-19 era for enhancing citizens' happiness and quality of life, conducting research and projects related to social prescribing, and promoting the spread of social prescribing systems. Additionally, the pandemic spread and radical social changes over the past few years have promoted the expansion of design methodologies into public health services. As public design evolved from enhancing the physical environment of social infrastructures such as spaces, facilities, architecture, and roads, contemporary design focuses on pursuing public value, addressing the essence of social issues, and enabling citizens to experience transformation. Therefore, this study aims to systematically analyze previous studies on social prescribing in the context of realizing a healthy society, consider its relationship with public design projects for social value, and suggest social design directions.(Method) Firstly, a total of nine articles related to 'social prescribing' published in the last five years at domestic and abroad were selected and research trends were identified through a systematic meta-analysis method. Secondly, as a result of it, we derived four major elements of social prescribing: Placeness, Accessibility, Connection, and Holisticity, and specified each of them. Thirdly, the degree of application of the elements was evaluated by FGI group participants and a researcher on a 5-point Likert scale, using representative cases of the social problem-solving design project. The correlation between the researcher's evaluation score and the FGI’s average score was analyzed as two variables, and the relationship between social prescription and the design projects through experts’perspectives.(Result) In evaluating the degree of relations based on the elements derived in this study, we found higher relationships between social prescribing and social problem-solving design projects in the areas of Placeness and Accessibility, and somewhat lower scores were observed in the areas of Connection and Holisticity. The overall correlation of the evaluation was statistically significant (r=0.635) between the FGI's and the researcher's evaluation results.(Conclusion) Today, to deal with the complex communities’ demands and to realize public value, it is necessary to expand the professional public design projects that not merely identify citizens' needs, but also introduce empirical evidence research. As a result of this study, we propose strengthening expertise and business sustainability based on evidence-based planning stages, creative social design practices, and empirical research to expand social connections and holistic design approaches. Subsequent research endeavors are anticipated to lead to the introduction of a comprehensive methodology and protocol for social design.

1. Introduction

1.1 Research Background and Purpose

Globally, people have faced threats not only to their physical health but also to their psychosocial well-being due to the severe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and profound preventive measures like social distancing. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2022 shared 'A Toolkit on How to Implement Social Prescribing'1) on its website for countries wishing to introduce the system, based on precedents from nations already implementing social prescribing necessary in the post-COVID era, aiming to prevent isolation, depression, and disconnection among people and build healthy societies.
Design, historically tending towards physical and methodological value built upon industrial and economic development foundations, has observed a shift since the 2000s towards participation-centered directions encompassing diverse people and cultures (Park, Goeun & Oh, Changsup, 2013). The direction of design aiming to address the increasingly complex societal demands and issues of the present era is realizing public value by introducing multidisciplinary collaboration and non-physical service approaches to solve community problems. Therefore, in this changing era, empirical and creative public design research is needed, capable of identifying the difficulties faced by individuals or society regarding social value and mobilizing local government and national efforts for clinical approaches and health care as coping directions.
Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to identify the key elements of social prescribing aimed at promoting the quality of life and health of diverse community members centered around the community, apply these to public design projects to examine the relationship, and propose design approaches for realizing more active public value.

1.2 Research Scope and Method

The scope of this study is limited to the search results from digital databases of domestic and international prior research on social prescribing published within the last 5 years. The evaluation of the applicability of social prescribing in public design projects is limited to representative cases among project domains published in the Seoul Metropolitan Government's Social Problem-Solving Design White Paper, which address contemporary issues similar to social prescribing, concerning citizens' safety and convenience, cognitive health and social connection, public-private governance, etc.
The research method involves, first, systematically meta-analyzing papers related to social prescribing from various countries worldwide. Second, deriving characteristic key elements of social prescribing from the analyzed results. Third, based on the derived key elements, applying them to completed and published public design cases and evaluating the relationship – how much the key elements of social prescribing are applied in public design projects – reflecting expert opinions through the Focus Group Interview (FGI) method. The results aim to objectively consider the social prescribing elements that should be applied in public design projects and propose a social design methodology for realizing public value through psychosocial safety nets when promoting future public design project plans.

2. Theoretical Background

2.1 Social Prescribing System

Social Prescribing refers comprehensively to a system where health and welfare sector workers connect service users with non-clinical, non-pharmacological environments within the community to support individuals with socio-emotional and practical needs in finding ways to enhance their health and well-being by utilizing community-provided services (WHO, 2022).

(Figure 1. Social Prescribing System (Referencing WHO, 2022) - Assumed to be provided)

As shown in <Figure 1>, the structure of social prescribing identifies the fundamental factors affecting patients' health and happiness. Through intermediaries called Link Workers who help connect clinical institutions and the community, it fosters individual happiness and quality of life improvement within their living environment, promotes surrounding relationships, prevents isolation, depression, and social disconnection, and facilitates psychological and physical activity, volunteering, economic support, and community participation, possessing holistic characteristics.

2.2 Community and Health Care

Various countries worldwide are actively implementing policies related to social prescribing based on the social determinants of health (Baek, Jihye, 2023, p.105) as ways to support mental health promotion and utilize communities healthily within citizens' living environments, as shown in <Table 1>.

(Table 1. Global Policy Examples Related to Social Prescribing - Assumed to be provided)

In Ontario, Canada, the Alliance for Healthier Communities, the implementing and evaluating body for a social prescribing pilot project collaborating between community medical institutions and cultural arts organizations, reported in 2020 that 80-90% of factors affecting participants' health originated from social factors (Nam, Haekweun et al., 2020).
In South Korea, while roles for caring for the elderly and disabled needing care have historically been delegated to nursing homes or care institutions, the Ministry of Health and Welfare announced the Community Integrated Care basic plan2) in 2018, providing community-centered care, medical, and welfare services together for the elderly. It operated pilot projects to implement the Aging In Place policy, enabling healthy aging within one's living environment.
From 2022, the target was expanded to include care policies for people with developmental disabilities. This indicates that community-centered care policy is not only applicable to the increasing elderly population but is gradually embracing universal social members truly needing multifaceted support and surrounding care, such as the disabled, mental health support recipients, and their families, aiming to establish community-level care safety nets (Yoo, Aejung & Park, Hyunkyung, 2022).
Thus, the role of governance involving government, local authorities, professional private collaboration, and multidisciplinary domains is becoming increasingly important to utilize care resources and promote health for diverse targets within the community.

3. Meta-analysis of Social Prescribing Literature and Derivation of Key Elements

3.1 Systematic Review and Meta-analysis

Generally, according to Shin Woojong's 2015 study, the meta-analysis method typically holds a very high level of evidence-based grading in large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials. The meta-analysis research process includes, first, a systematic review method where the researcher selects research subjects using approaches like PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) (Mclnnes et al., 2018) <see Figure 2>, and analyzes collected individual data using an analysis framework. Second, it includes methods for re-analyzing the effectiveness of intervention methods using statistical techniques for multifaceted interpretation and indicators based on the previously analyzed results. However, this paper utilizes the first approach to identify recent research trends through collected literature and derive key elements related to the topic.

3.2 Research Subject Selection

This study utilized searches of domestic and international digital databases to collect literature related to social prescribing within the last 5 years. For domestic papers, '사회적 처방' (social prescribing) was searched in the Academic Information Service System (RISS) and DBpia. For international papers, 'Social Prescribing' or 'Social Prescription' was searched on Science Direct and Pubmed sites to collect literature.
The collection resulted in a total of 53,312 domestic and international documents related to social prescribing <Figure 2>. Using the PRISMA method, 53,284 research materials were excluded – those where blinding was not conducted, duplicates of theses, documents without confirmable abstracts, bibliographic information not registered as research within the last 5 years, and documents whose research topic was distant from social prescribing – narrowing down to 28 research documents. Among these, excluding 19 documents adopting qualitative research methods, a final 9 documents (approximately 188 cases), including 5 international papers and 4 domestic papers, were selected as the subjects of this study.

3.3 Research Analysis Framework

The analysis method for the prior research on social prescribing involved one researcher summarizing and writing each of the 9 prior studies according to the analysis framework items, as shown in <Table 2>. The framework was broadly classified into bibliographic information, research subjects and methods, and dependent variables. Accordingly, bibliographic information was detailed by publication year and field, scope, and number of cases. Research subjects were sub-classified by gender and age, related issues, and country/region. Research methods were summarized and classified by research purpose and design method, program intervention method and duration, and evaluation method. Among the dependent variables based on the results of program operation and system implementation reported in each prior study, variables showing high numerical values in measurement tests or significant changes reported through clinical description were set as Very Strong (●), while variables showing weak but potential changes among described changes were classified as Very Weak (○) on a 5-point scale visualization. The themes of these visualized variables were then re-categorized by the researcher into individual psychological change & mental health, and social domains.

3.4 Analysis of Social Prescribing Prior Research Trends

3.4.1 Analysis of Bibliographic Information and Research Subjects
Analyzing the prior research subjects based on the analysis method referencing the <Table 2> framework, visualizing the data by bibliographic information and research subject criteria through frequency graphs resulted in high frequency appearances in the fields of health & medicine, and psychology, as shown in <Table 3>. Most studies were conducted in the UK and European regions, with studies targeting the elderly or adults regardless of gender showing high frequency characteristics.

(Table 3. Analysis of Bibliographic Information and Research Subjects in Prior Social Prescribing Research - Assumed to be provided)

3.4.2 Analysis of Research Methods
Analysis results of research methods in prior studies, as shown in <Table 4>, indicated a relatively high frequency of referrals through intermediaries like link workers and voluntary participation where subjects selected social prescribing programs themselves in both domestic and international research. The frequency of intervention methods involving physical activity and artistic approaches like art, music, and horticulture was particularly prominent. Locations for social prescribing included diverse community places such as museums, parks, and forests. Many studies verified intervention effectiveness through pre/post evaluation. Most studies involved short-term intervention methods within one year.

3.4.3 Analysis of Dependent Variables
Analyzing the dependent variables of the prior social prescribing research targeted in this study, as shown in <Table 5>, observed significant changes in the psychological/emotional domain following depression reduction and increased self-esteem/confidence, the health promotion aspect of improved well-being and mental health, and enhanced social participation levels and strengthened support relationships/networks.

(Table 5. Analysis of Dependent Variables in Prior Social Prescribing Research - Assumed to be provided)

3.5 Derivation of 4 Key Elements of Social Prescribing

Based on the comprehensive analysis results of prior research, the key elements of social prescribing identified are: 'Placeness,' involving the active utilization of community environments and resources for improving quality of life; 'Accessibility,' mediating or facilitating access to utilize community resources independently according to needs; 'Connection,' fostering social participation to form healthy community relationships, promote interaction, and build psychosocial safety nets; and 'Holisticity,' a holistic approach involving and supporting individuals and society across psychological-physical health promotion, job-housing economic stability, etc. These can be classified into a total of 4 elements as shown in <Table 6>.

(Table 6. 4 Key Elements of Social Prescribing and Classification Criteria - Assumed to be provided)

3.6 Public Design Social Problem-Solving Design Projects

Efforts in public design to solve issues and promote safety within communities, similar to social prescribing which aims to enhance citizens' health and address community issues, can be confirmed through the recently published Seoul Metropolitan Government's Social Problem-Solving Design White Paper3). To understand multifaceted social problems and effect efficient environmental changes for supporting quality of life improvement, Seoul City published a white paper in 2022 detailing the outcomes and impacts of Social Problem-Solving Design projects implemented from 2012 to 2020, applying service design methodologies to prevent and resolve social losses. Seoul's public design projects increasingly feel the need for research into experiential, multidisciplinary, and technological design methodologies to meet the complex needs within the community, aiming to provide 'problem-solving environments tailored to each individual citizen.' It also states a direction towards expanded research encompassing psychological and emotional aspects of citizens' environmental responses through neuropsychological verification and experiments (Kang, Hyojin, 2017).

(Figure 3. Key Social Issues Addressed by Seoul's Social Problem-Solving Design4) - Assumed to be provided)

The social issues addressed by Social Problem-Solving Design, as shown in <Figure 3>, range from societal problems beyond individual control like crime or school violence, to individual citizens' stress, obesity, and cognitive health promotion like dementia prevention, treating them as service design agendas and aiming to address them comprehensively through design methods. The scope of application for these projects is classified into a total of eight categories as specified according to Article 3 of the Seoul Metropolitan Government Ordinance enacted in 2018, as shown in <Table 7>.

(Table 7. Scope of Application for Seoul's Social Problem-Solving Design - Assumed to be provided)

The Social Problem-Solving Design project domains examined alongside the 4 key elements of social prescribing in this study correspond to a total of five areas in <Table 8>: Life Safety (Crime Prevention) Design, Cognitive Health Design, Stress Relief Design, Youth Problem-Solving Design, and Design Governance. The implementation status of each area is as follows.
First, the Life Safety Design area evolved from the CPTED-focused crime prevention design projects initiated in 2012 (Mapo-gu Yeomni-dong pilot) towards projects based on Design Against Crime solutions, gradually changing into sustainable life safety design projects aiming for user-centered problem-solving and community revitalization through collaboration with related institutions like police stations, 조성ing safe village paths, improving environments, etc., totaling 67 sites by 2020.
Second, due to rapid aging and increased population with cognitive health disorders, Cognitive Health Design projects were established targeting residential areas with high elderly ratios, aiming to improve orientation, concentration, memory, etc., through environmental 조성s stimulating cognitive functions and enhancing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Starting with 1 street-guidance type site in 2014 and 1 small apartment complex village type site in Yeongdeungpo-gu Singil-dong in 2015, a total of 7 sites were 조성ed by 2020, implementing small/large scale, street guidance/hub types, park types, and comprehensive guidelines.
Third, considering South Korea's notably high suicide rate and daily stress experience rate (81%) among OECD countries, Stress Relief Design projects were operated, employing design approaches to address citizens' mental health domains, preventing linkage to various social problems and aiming to reduce social costs. Starting with 1 youth-centered project in Jungnang-gu in 2016 and 1 subway user-centered design project at Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station in 2017, a total of 9 projects were conducted by 2019.
Fourth, addressing socially significant issues like school violence, delinquency, obesity, depression, digital overdependence, and bullying, Youth Problem-Solving Design projects were promoted, analyzing school environments and youth culture to identify emotional issues within peer culture and aiming for improvement through design. Starting with 1 site in Eunpyeong-gu in 2014 and projects improving nearby school routes and creating play spaces at Banghak Middle School in Dobong-gu in 2015, a total of 9 projects were promoted by 2019.
Fifth, Design Governance projects were conducted, where citizens directly identify public issues and select project themes via voting, aiming to substantially improve quality of life and allow citizens to experience the change, implemented through convergence with diverse stakeholders. Starting with 4 projects including the Seoul Land Braille map toolkit design in 2015, and projects like the 'Parenthesis Light' design inducing safe nighttime cycling in Han River Park in 2016, a total of 24 projects were conducted by 2019.
This study reviewed the applicability and relationship of social prescribing system elements focusing on the first case introduced among representative projects in each domain, as presented in the 2011-2021 Seoul Social Problem-Solving Design White Paper.

4. Evaluation of Social Prescribing Element Application in Public Design Projects and Introduction Directions

4.1 Evaluation Method for Social Prescribing Element Application
The 4 key element criteria of social prescribing derived in this study were classified, and representative cases of public design social problem-solving projects were selected referencing these. Then, 7 expert participants and the researcher each evaluated them using the FGI method.5) After participants were briefed on social prescribing, the social problem-solving design projects, and the evaluation content regarding the degree of application, they rated the application of the 4 key element criteria of social prescribing <see Table 6> for each case using a 5-point Likert scale (5 points for very high application, 1 point for very low application), recorded their scores on a digital survey form, and submitted it. Subsequently, the researcher collected the FGI scoring results evaluating the degree of application of the 4 social prescribing elements in the public design projects, coded them using Excel® 2021 software, and summarized them as shown in <Table 9>.

(Table 9. Evaluation Results of Applying Social Prescribing Elements in Seoul's Social Problem-Solving Design (Application Level: Very High(●): 5~4, Very Low(○): 2~1) - Assumed to be provided)

To analyze the correlation between evaluation scores, the FGI average and the researcher's evaluation score were set as respective variables. The Correlation Coefficient, indicating the linear relationship between the two variables, was calculated. The result showed a relatively high positive correlation (r=0.635), indicating a statistically significant relationship between the FGI average evaluation score and the researcher's evaluation figure.

4.2 Evaluation Results of Social Prescribing Element Application Degree
Summarizing the evaluation results of applying key social prescribing elements in actual public design cases <Table 9>, the element showing the highest degree of application was 'Placeness,' which involves actively utilizing, improving, and newly creating community or place environments and resources. The 'Accessibility' element, which helps users easily access and utilize relevant place or service information, also showed high scores in the evaluation results. This suggests that public design projects addressing social problem-solving prominently feature aspects centered around improving and 조성ing community resources, environments, and facilities, along with improving informational and environmental accessibility.
Meanwhile, the 'Connection' element of social prescribing, which builds psychosocial safety nets by connecting people-to-people or people-to-community, promoting solidarity, showed relatively low scores in the evaluation of application in public design cases. Furthermore, 'Holisticity,' which addresses citizens' faced social issues from multiple perspectives including individual and social, psychosocial health, economic, and cultural aspects, intervening and seeking a healthy society, was measured as the lowest-scoring element in the evaluation.
Additionally, regarding the 'necessity of introducing social prescribing elements in future public design projects,' expert interview results showed that 5 out of 7 participants (71%) responded it was very necessary. Opinions included 'expansion of social prescribing for cultural enjoyment aiming to improve everyone's quality of life and promote publicness is needed,' and 'introduction is necessary for designing for all members of society, regardless of individual health challenges (disability, illness, etc.).' Furthermore, developmental opinions for future research were included, such as 'while the need for introducing social prescribing in public design projects seems high, the direction for effective application is a future task,' indicating the need for subsequent research to address practical social prescribing design methodologies in public design.

4.3 Consideration and Suggestions for Public Value Realization through Social Prescribing and Public Design Project Directions
This study derived 4 characteristic elements of social prescribing through systematic review and meta-analysis of recent prior research. It then applied these elements to representative cases of Seoul City's Social Problem-Solving Design, which addresses similar community issues and aims to improve citizens' quality of life, evaluating the relationship through the FGI method. The results allowed examination of common implications between public design projects for community public value and social prescribing, as well as elements and domains requiring active introduction.
Firstly, the placeness and accessibility characteristics of public design projects – identifying local resources and place features, 조성ing village paths reflecting residents' needs, building safe alleys, improving environments through collaboration with local public institutions or facilities – aligned most closely with the direction in prior social prescribing research involving referring patients to community resources and environments, utilizing places, and collaborating with public welfare systems to facilitate access.
Meanwhile, the 'Link Worker' in social prescribing policy, specialized personnel supporting access and linkage to community resources for target individuals, emerged as needing more active promotion in public design projects that facilitate resident participation or act as navigators/facilitators for design domains, assisting in assessing and accurately linking citizens' diverse needs and requirements.
This study revealed that for social design projects embodying publicness, a multi-faceted design assessment based on user-centered evidence is necessary, moving beyond project operation methods primarily aimed at improving physical environments, facilities, and accessibility. Furthermore, empirical research is needed on holistic design approaches that foster changes citizens can experience in daily life and promote participation in projects directly and indirectly through design interventions mediating service accessibility between local resources, people, and interpersonal connections.

5. Conclusion

In the current era, discourse and practical demands regarding healthy social design embodying social values are increasing. This signifies the need for professional efforts embracing diverse social members and promoting multifaceted approaches to enhance healthy social connection networks in the post-COVID era.
This study does not advocate for the indiscriminate introduction of welfare systems from leading countries. Rather, recognizing that the goals pursued by social prescribing and the direction of design for healthy communities ultimately converge towards the pursuit of public value, it systematically analyzed recent prior research on the global trend of social prescribing. By deriving key elements, introducing and applying them to public design projects, and considering the results through the FGI method, it proposes the following stepwise approach directions for design aimed at realizing contemporary community public value.
First, the planning stage must explore evidence-based approaches, employing multi-faceted design assessments to accurately respond to the needs of people living in the present era and contemporary social issues. Second, practical research is needed to establish creative social design protocols that enhance user-centered quality of life and promote healthy societies. Third, strengthening professionalism and project sustainability through empirical research responsive to community and citizen needs is required.
To address the complex issues demanded by contemporary communities and realize public value, there is an increasing need to expand the professionalism of public design projects, not only identifying citizens' needs and requirements but also predicting and preventing issues by introducing clinical evidence-based empirical research. It is hoped that future efforts will lead to practical research on holistic design methodologies and the establishment of protocols for objective evidence-based social design prescribing.

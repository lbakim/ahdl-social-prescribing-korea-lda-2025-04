A Study on Development Protocol of Museum Programs based on Social Prescribing Design as Public Service for Community

Abstract

(Background and Purpose) Contemporary global paradigms advocate for proactive governmental and local authority engagement in addressing mental health-related issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the implementation of social prescribing as an integrated community resource-linked public service. As public design evolves towards the pursuit of public value and expands into health and welfare domains, the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism's "2024 Social Connectivity by Culture" initiative signifies a pivotal shift towards introducing social prescribing-based public services. This study aims to establish a robust foundation for implementing a domestically tailored social prescribing system and health-supporting public service design by developing a systematic protocol centered on museums as community-oriented public service providers.(Method) This study employed the five-stage ADDIE model (Analysis-Design-Development-Implementation-Evaluation). First, the Analysis phase investigated and examined a selected museum and its decade-long programs as community public services. Second, the Design phase conducted surveys to ascertain the perceptions and needs of potential adult participants regarding museums and public services. Third, the Development phase created museum programs supporting societal health, based on analyses of public services provided by eight selected institutions and survey results. Fourth, the Implementation phase executed a social prescribing design museum program with 30 adult participants at P Museum in Yongin, Gyeonggi-do, utilizing the developed program. Finally, the Evaluation phase comprehensively assessed the social prescribing design program through multifaceted methods, including participants' overall satisfaction surveys, feedback, and expert interviews. This systematic approach ensured a thorough exploration of the potential for museums to serve as effective providers of health-supporting public services within the community context.(Results) Feedback on the systematically developed social prescription design protocol revealed its significant potential to contribute to community mental health care (86.6%) and foster community connections (83.3%) if provided continuously. Consequently, this protocol is expected to serve as a foundational framework for implementing supportive public health service designs that enhance existing services to meet citizens' needs appropriately and effectively.(Conclusion) This study concludes that museums must proactively identify and incorporate health-supporting public services from the initial planning stage, collaborate with multidisciplinary specialists to promote holistic well-being in nonclinical settings, and establish a systematic, evidence-based protocol for sustainable and high-quality community programs. We anticipate that future research will empirically verify the effectiveness of this innovative approach, and that this comprehensive protocol will aid museums in delivering impactful and transformative community social services, thereby contributing significantly to the broader fields of public health, social welfare, and community well-being.

1. Introduction

1.1 Research Background and Purpose

Today's global issues, such as rapid environmental changes, pandemic outbreaks, and mental health threats to social safety nets, are not confined to single nations but possess characteristics requiring contemporary response strategies. Countries like the UK, Canada, and the US view mental health-related issues akin to global disasters like war or climate crises and are preparing national and community response policies to form basic social safety nets.
Last year, the Korean government successively announced initiatives like the 1st Basic Plan for Solitary Death Prevention,1) Mental Health Policy Innovation Plan,2) and Support Plan for Isolated/Reclusive Youth3) as part of mental health promotion policies, publicizing joint responses by relevant ministries. The main gist of this approach is the government's active engagement in addressing social issues such as individual loneliness, isolation, reclusion, and depression. It also aims to pursue multifaceted efforts, including inter-ministerial and public-private cooperation, to improve and resolve the current situation. Ultimately, it seeks to expand welfare benefits to include everyday prevention, beyond just medical treatment and counseling domains, as concrete measures for promoting mental health that threatens the social safety net.
In fact, the UK had already institutionalized social prescribing, a public service for everyday mental health welfare that identifies community resources across diverse cultural, artistic, environmental, and economic sectors and links them with users. In 2018, a ministerial post responsible for isolation and loneliness was appointed, and starting from 2023, active implementation steps are being taken, such as regional cabinets reporting on social prescribing implementation frameworks.4)
At a time when public design is evolving towards pursuing public value, and its approach domain is being promoted and expanded into welfare, health, and social services, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism's '2024 Culture for Social Solidarity'5) project, in particular, signifies a trend towards activating cooperative public services linked to community health care related to social prescribing.
Of course, Korea has different health and welfare systems and policies compared to the UK, posing limitations in directly adopting foreign policies domestically. Therefore, this study aims to provide a foundation for health-supporting public service design suitable for the domestic environment by investigating and analyzing the current status of domestic museum programs centered on culture and arts among public service domains, applying social prescribing design methodology optimized for the current system, and systematically researching a museum program development protocol.

1.2 Research Scope and Method

This study focuses on museums, centered around culture and arts among various public services, based on the social prescribing design methodology, as limited in <Table 1>. The regional scope is set to 10 areas among cities/counties/districts in the southern part of the metropolitan area (5 autonomous districts south of the Han River in Seoul Metropolitan City and 5 basic cities in southern Gyeonggi Province). The temporal scope is limited to museum programs conducted over 10 years (2015-2024).

(Table 1. Scope of this study - Assumed to be provided, detailing Scope: Museum, Target: Culture/Arts programs, Time: 2015-2024, Region: 10 southern metro areas)

The research method follows the total 5 stages of the ADDIE model (Branch, 2009), frequently utilized in program development in fields like clinical practice and education (Analysis-Design-Development-Implementation-Evaluation), conducted as follows.
First, investigate representative cases of cultural arts-centered programs from community museums within the research scope and comparatively analyze them based on the key principles of social prescribing design methodology. Second, systematically develop an integrated approach combining museum programs and community-centered art therapy to pilot social prescribing programs aimed at improving quality of life, promoting mental health care, and supporting relationship formation through community resource utilization. Third, based on participant feedback after implementing the developed program and feedback from interviews with experts in culture, arts, design, education, and clinical fields, modify and supplement the program. Finally, develop the derived community museum-centered social prescribing design program protocol step-by-step to research the procedural design for implementation beyond methodology.

2. Theoretical Background

2.1 Social Prescribing Design

Generally, the concept of 'prescribing (處方)' or 'prescription (處方箋)' in the clinical domain refers to a document containing methods for preparing medications according to set instructions given by a doctor to a patient for treatment. However, the meaning of 'prescription' used outside the medical domain implies 'making or writing execution rules,' 'designing solutions for problem-solving.'6) Based on this, the Social Prescribing Design methodology was proposed (Joo et al., 2023), intertwined with the contemporary demand for policy strategies requiring accurate identification of the mechanisms behind difficulties faced by our society and fundamental responses.
Prior research derived 4 key elements (Placeness, Accessibility, Connection, Holisticity) of the 'social prescribing system'7) which utilizes community resources for health care based on social determinants of health and supports quality of life and well-being through non-pharmacological environments and social connections. It was devised as a design intervention aiming for a more 'holistic approach.' The implementation direction of this methodology refers to evidence-based design practices that identify community hub locations and resources, devise structural alternatives or personnel to connect these with users, create systems enabling users to easily access and utilize resources, and promote the formation of social safety nets through economic, social, cultural, and psychological support (ibid, 2023).

2.2 Public Service and Design Intervention

Reviewing the concept and definition of public service, which this study addresses through social prescribing design: traditional economists define it as 'all services supplied and provided to citizens by public institutions led by the government.' However, services for the public should not be limited to intangible actions provided solely by the government; if the private sector provides public services characterized by non-rivalrous consumption and non-excludability, they should be considered public services (Ahn et al., 2009). Therefore, public service encompasses tangible and intangible services produced and supplied by public institutions and the private sector to meet citizens' public demands, including security, education, culture/arts, healthcare, welfare, food hygiene, housing, civil petitions, railways, communication, postal services, etc. Redesigning these public services appropriately by capturing citizens' thoughts, choices, behaviors, etc., when using them is called public service design. That is, it refers to designing appropriate services in a public-interest direction for the public, centered around people's actions, thoughts, feelings, experiences, etc.
The Korea Institute of Design Promotion (KIDP), through the National Design Group guide, introduces a public service design approach realistically needed through the process of 'Understanding - Discovering Needs - Defining Real Problems - Developing Ideas - Delivering Services' (Ministry of the Interior and Safety, 2019). However, while this approach holds significance in addressing problems through direct citizen participation, challenges are pointed out regarding stakeholders' low understanding of the approach and difficulties in fully utilizing the roles and capabilities of specialized personnel (Ahn & Koo, 2020). Therefore, systematic design research is required for providing public services in a qualitative, professional, and sustainable manner.

2.3 Culture & Arts Centered Museum Public Service

Representative institutions and places providing culture and arts-centered public services in the community are 'museums' (art museums or general museums).8) The International Council of Museums (ICOM) states that the purpose of museum establishment lies in efforts for 'social service practice' (Reyhani & Daugherty, 2023)<Table 2>.

(Table 2. Domestic Prior Research Related to Museum Social Service Practice - Assumed to be provided)

Today, public national museums face policy challenges to design appropriate interactions embracing diverse audiences like the disabled and elderly, who were relatively excluded previously, by improving spatial environments, exhibitions, information delivery methods and tools, services, programs, etc.9) Furthermore, non-profit private museums are also continuously receiving attention regarding the importance of providing public-spirited community cultural experience services.
Cultural and artistic approaches in museum environments act as non-invasive, less threatening intervention methods for humans, serving as a safe 'the third thing.' Therefore, they become community-centered approaches where visitors naturally connect with artifacts or artworks, evoking inspiration, and also acting as 'intermediary objects' connecting people to each other (ibid, 2023, p.201).
As shown in <Table 3>, researching public service methods for providing mental health and support programs in museum environments open to diverse audiences aligns with the design practice of realizing public value.

(Table 3. Domestic and International Literature Research on Mental Health and Museum Programs - Assumed to be provided)

2.4 Mental Health and Design Intervention Prior Research

Design has diversified its research topics according to social changes, addressing contemporary issues and responding to societal demands. In the past, design primarily focused on research for designing physical products supporting general health promotion, such as well-being products and exercise equipment, signage for the elderly and disabled, and universal design.
However, since the late 2010s, interest in design and psychology has increased, activating research on digital services or user-centered health service design. Furthermore, combining art therapy interventions with design domains, 'mental health' and 'psychotherapy' are newly being included as design research topics (Roh & Eune, 2016). Additionally, the pandemic outbreak in the 2020s highlighted issues of social safety and health care, promoting the expansion of the design domain into health and welfare services, clinical research, and even into designing public-interest mental health service interventions.
To investigate domestic recent (last 5 years) prior research related to mental health and design, searches were conducted in two KCI-indexed academic journal databases using the keywords '정신건강 (mental health) AND 디자인 (design)'. As shown in <Table 4>, the results yielded 2 articles from the Korea Citation Index and 57 from DBpia. Excluding 7 papers addressing topics not directly related to design or mental health, a total of 50 documents were confirmed.

(Table 4. Search Results of Prior Design Research Related to Mental Health (Duplicate frequency: 5+● / 3-4◐ /1-2○) - Assumed to be provided)

Examining the trend of mental health-related design research over the past 5 years from the search results reveals an increase in the number of related design papers from 2019 to 2023. Analysis based on topic keywords confirmed a shift from research on health-supporting product/interior/environmental design towards community-centered care (Jang et al., 2022) and interaction (Lee, 2021), specific emotions like depression/self-esteem/happiness (Park et al., 2020; Kim & Koo, 2022), diverse target groups such as adolescents/working moms/sexual crime survivors (Park, 2023), service design (Moon et al., 2022), or digital service (Yang et al., 2022) research. Trends towards multifaceted research addressing previously overlooked subjects, diseases, services, communities, and local care are emerging. This confirms a progression from physical design approaches towards non-physical social service improvement or community-centered design intervention research in the process of addressing delicate contemporary societal issues like mental health.

3. ADDIE Model-Based Social Prescribing Design Protocol Development

3.1 ADDIE Model and Protocol Research

The dictionary definition of Protocol refers to etiquette, custom, treaty drafts, or minutes. In fields like medicine, education, and counseling services where professional execution is required, standardizing procedures to reduce errors even when computer specifications or users change, protocol refers to the foundational process for devising standardized methods. Generally, protocol research for program development through unified procedures and consistent intervention is conducted in service areas requiring professional execution like education, clinical practice, and therapy.
The ADDIE model applied in this study for developing a social prescribing design-based public service protocol consists of 5 stages: Analysis-Design-Development-Implementation-Evaluation, through which the research was conducted. This model has been utilized in developing leisure activity intervention programs for preventing elderly suicide (Yi et al., 2010) and improving procedural management systems applied to nursing students in clinical practice settings (Kim et al., 2023).

3.2 Progression through Analysis-Design-Development-Implementation-Evaluation

3.2.1 Analysis
The number of registered museums within the regional and spatial scope of this study (parts of the southern metropolitan area) totaled 37, as shown in <Table 5>. (National Statistics Portal, 2020) The distribution of registered museums by region showed the fewest in Geumcheon-gu (0) and the most in Seocho-gu (11) as of April 2024.

(Table 5. Registered Museum Status in 10 Southern Metropolitan Areas - Assumed to be provided)

Subsequently, 8 representative institutions among those providing community cultural arts public services for over 10 years were selected. These institutions regularly operated educational and experiential activities or family-friendly programs to promote community cultural arts enjoyment, as stated in their institutional visions. To objectively identify resources convertible into social prescribing intervention programs by analyzing the characteristics of these programs, 3 researchers individually evaluated the relevance to the 4 key elements of the social prescribing system using a 5-point Likert scale. The results were compiled, and the degree of potential conversion to social prescribing public service was calculated and summarized graphically.10)

(Table 6. Case Study of Cultural Arts Public Services at 8 Representative Institutions within Research Scope (Relevance: Very High●/ High⊙/ Moderate◐/ Low◎/ Very Low○) - Assumed to be provided)

3.2.2 Design
In the analysis stage of this study, information about the 8 representative museums and their programs operated over 10 years was investigated. Based on this, the applicability potential for linkage with social prescribing design public service was evaluated by 3 researchers individually using the 4 key elements (Placeness, Accessibility, Connection, Holisticity). Although most provided programs targeting community residents, the diverse programs offered by the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (MMCA) <Figure 1>, which embrace diverse audiences including disabled individuals and their families towards realizing public value public service provision, utilized community-centered art therapy in educational programs11) by directly employing and operating clinical field expert personnel.

(Figure 1. Museum Art Therapy Program Enhancing Accessibility for Diverse Audiences - Assumed to be provided)

Therefore, despite this institution having somewhat lower geographical accessibility, its program application degree was measured highest in the researchers' evaluation of social prescribing linkage potential. Thus, it was applied and referenced for developing museum programs for social prescribing design public service.

3.2.3 Development
Prior to the development stage, a basic survey12) regarding community museums and public services was conducted non-face-to-face with randomly selected adults aged 19+ who are potential users of museum public services. Most participants were aware of museums in their area, but direct visit experiences were somewhat divided. Furthermore, needs for improved cultural arts accessibility, diverse and inclusive public services, and welfare/care programs were identified. They also recognized the necessity of collaboration reflecting art therapy interventions for museums to realize this. Key survey items related to museum art therapy collaboration for a healthy society showed significant reliability (Cronbach α, .724) via IBM SPSS Statistics 25 analysis.
Referencing this, the art therapy intervention methods of the MMCA's <Share·Empathy> program, planned in 2015 and operated for 10 years, were reflected. Additionally, a 'social prescribing design public service program' utilizing prompts to aid meaning-making for viewers, based on community-based museum art therapy intervention, was developed. The developed program was documented and organized by the researcher using MS PowerPoint, then modified and supplemented based on non-face-to-face interviews with 3 experts13) regarding overall program composition, intervention methods, procedures, guidance, etc.

3.2.4 Implementation
The social prescribing public service program, designed through the systematic stages of analysis-design-development, was implemented directly by the researcher in charge. The research subjects were 30 Y University students (adults aged 19+) in Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, who voluntarily completed consent forms expressing interest in understanding their psychology and stress responses. A pilot operation was conducted once for about 2.5 hours at P Museum within the community, as shown in <Figure 2>.

(Figure 2. Implementation of the Developed Social Prescribing Design Protocol Program - Assumed to be provided)

3.2.5 Evaluation
Participants in the implementation stage all engaged in the systematically developed social prescribing design-based public service program according to set procedures, providing feedback through a post-program survey. Participant surveys evaluated changes in perception and interest levels regarding community museums, art therapy, and care for others' and one's own health. Subsequently, semi-structured interviews regarding the overall protocol evaluation were conducted individually with 3 experts14) in museums and art therapy, after explaining the materials and content of the implemented program protocol. Based on the comprehensive expert evaluation results, the detailed steps and component contents of the protocol implementation system were supplemented and improved.

4. Results and Suggestions of the Social Prescribing Design Protocol Research as Public Service

4.1 Comprehensive Evaluation Results of the Social Prescribing Design Museum Program

This study investigated museum programs provided over 10 years centered around community cultural arts, developed a public service protocol for converting them into social prescribing interventions for a healthy society following the five stages of analysis-design-development-implementation-evaluation based on the protocol design procedure, conducted the program, and then evaluated it. Satisfaction survey results from 30 adult participants showed that 77.5% responded satisfied or very satisfied across all program items. Analyzing detailed question items regarding participant feedback on the program, as shown in <Figure 3>, most survey items concerning perception, understanding, interest, role, and necessity of introduction showed positive responses above moderate levels.

(Figure 3. Participant Feedback Results on the Social Prescribing Design Museum Program of this Study - Assumed to be provided)

Participants who engaged in the program developed through the social prescribing design protocol reported increased awareness of community museums compared to before the program, and also demonstrated increased understanding of museum art therapy interventions. Interest and awareness regarding others were also confirmed to have slightly increased compared to before program participation, and interest in their own psychological and mental health was reported to have somewhat increased. Most importantly, unlike the perception that entering hospitals or clinical environments is difficult due to surrounding gazes or psychological barriers, the perception of museum art therapy programs was positively judged as more easily accessible than medical, counseling, or therapy institutions. Based on this, 26 participants (86.6%) responded 'agree' or higher regarding the potential role of this program in supporting community citizens' psychological and mental health if operated regularly. Furthermore, 25 participants (83.3%) viewed that regular participation in this program would be helpful in forming surrounding relationships within the community, acquiring social support networks, and building connections.
Through this, the comprehensive opinions received from participants in the museum program developed via this social prescribing design methodology and from expert interviews allowed gauging the effect of increasing awareness, interest, and participation in community cultural arts institutions. Additionally, the comprehensive evaluation results confirmed that most participants wished for this program to be introduced into existing art museum and museum programs, operated more regularly, and hoped it could strengthen support for community mental health and psychological care.
Following the ICOM's goals since 2022 regarding museum diversity, inclusion, and sustainability policies, it is hoped that the introduction of this program embracing various audiences and collaboration with the community can be promoted. This ultimately aims for museums to expand their role in providing community-centered public services that foster and care for healthy social bonds linked to the community safety net.

4.2 Social Prescribing Design Protocol as Public Service

This study developed a museum program based on social prescribing design methodology to introduce public services needed and required by local citizens and propose a model suitable for the current situation. It researched the entire process of development, implementation, and evaluation, visualizing it as the Social Prescribing Design Protocol shown in <Figure 4>.

(Figure 4. Social Prescribing Design Protocol of this Study15) - Assumed to be provided)

Providing professional and stable public services is necessary to operate programs for mental health, health support, and inclusion of diverse target groups in non-clinical environments. Accordingly, the protocol proposal incorporating a holistic design approach that evenly covers the existing 4 key elements of social prescribing is expected to enable practitioners implementing it to apply the systematic procedures revealed through the research results in the practical planning and execution of projects with public value. Therefore, when designing intangible public-oriented services, it is argued that comprehensive design and consistent execution following visualized processes like the one below are necessary.

5. Conclusion

Contemporary public design for communities signifies more than just physical improvements like products, installations, applications, or spatial 조성. Community public service encompasses processes including citizen participation and reflection of opinions, collaborative systems, institutions, and laws. Social design for health support can promote basic interactions among local residents and fundamentally contribute practically to subjective well-being and trust, which bolster community safety.
This study addressed a social prescribing design protocol enabling the conversion and implementation of museum education, as a culture/arts-centered public service, into health-supporting museum programs responding to citizens' needs. Accordingly, this study derived the following conclusions.
First, accurately identifying practical needs from the planning stage and discovering appropriate resources to holistically apply them is crucial for introducing health-supporting museum programs as public services required by contemporary community citizens. Second, collaboration with professional domains, such as art therapy counseling, is essential for museums, as non-clinical environments, to perform the task of promoting healthy social communication and emotional well-being. Lastly, to operate social prescribing design museum programs safely and sustainably at a qualitative level as community public services, establishing a practical protocol operational system reflecting systematic implementation stages and user feedback is necessary.
Limitations of this study include reflecting small-scale target groups of adults aged 19+ in some metropolitan areas, making generalization to the entire nation or all age groups difficult. However, accurately applying the needs of specific regions, institutions, and target groups through the social prescribing design protocol for health care public service programs can lead to universal, specific, and diversified expansion and practice. It is hoped that subsequent research will build a practical bridge by applying the protocol of this study from multiple angles, introducing evidence-based empirical research such as social experiments and effectiveness verification. Furthermore, it is hoped that the protocol of this study will be utilized in public service design and its practice for diversity, inclusion, and sustainable approaches of community museums as social service implementing institutions.

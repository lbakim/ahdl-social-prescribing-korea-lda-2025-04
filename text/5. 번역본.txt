Evaluating the social prescribing pilot project’s effect on depression and loneliness among rural elderly in Korea

Abstract

Objectives: This study aimed to confirm the effectiveness of the social prescribing pilot project for the elderly aged 65 and above in rural areas. In particular, the study aimed to measure the elderly’s depression, cognitive function, and loneliness before and after the social prescribing pilot project.
Method: To this end, a non-equality control group pretest-posttest design was used, with 131 individuals aged 65 and above, living in Wonju, Gangwon-do (75 in the experimental group and 56 in the control group). SGDS-K was used as a measurement tool for depression, MMSE-K was used as a cognitive function measurement tool, and ULS-8 was used as a measurement tool for loneliness. Music Story Telling, a social prescribing intervention program, was conducted once a week for a total of eight weeks. For statistical analysis, T-test and DiD (Difference in Differences) analysis were conducted to confirm the significant difference in scores before and after intervention, and the effectiveness of intervention.
Results: It was confirmed that depression significantly decreased after the implementation of the Music Story Telling program compared to the control group, who participated in the social prescribing pilot project (p&lt;.05). Loneliness also significantly reduced (p&lt;.05), while cognitive function was found to be slightly improved, but was not statistically significant.
Conclusion: This study confirmed the effectiveness of the social prescribing pilot project in reducing depression and loneliness among the elderly in rural areas. It can hence be used as a new model to reduce elderly depression and improve their mental health. Additionally, it can be used as a basis to develop ways to revitalize Korea's social prescribing for the promotion of elderly mental health.

I. Introduction

South Korea's elderly population is increasing. As of August 2022, the proportion of the elderly population aged 65 and over in Korea is 17.7%. It is projected that by 2025, the nationwide elderly population ratio will exceed 20%, making Korea a super-aged society (Statistics Korea, 2022). The speed of aging in Korea is unprecedented in human history, surpassing even Japan's pace (Klassen, 2010).

At this point of rapid population aging, what is the quality of life for Korean elderly? Quality of life is known to influence depression and suicidal ideation (Kim & Yun, 2020; Oh, 2012). Examining the elderly suicide rate by OECD country reveals that South Korea ranks first among OECD member nations with 46.6 per 100,000 people, compared to the OECD average of 17.2. Considering the overall suicide rate for all ages in Korea is 26.6, it is evident that the elderly suicide rate is high (Ministry of Health and Welfare [MOHW] & Korea Foundation for Suicide Prevention [KFSP], 2022). Suicide is not unrelated to depression. Previous studies report that most individuals who died by suicide exhibited depressive symptoms at the time of death (Mann et al., 2005; Emslie, Ridge, Ziebland, & Hunt, 2006).

However, 13.5% of Korean elderly suffer from depression (MOHW, 2021). Research indicates that loneliness accounts for 18% of the causes of elderly depression, and groups with higher levels of loneliness were more likely to develop depression over time (Lee et al., 2021). Furthermore, studies also show that loneliness affects changes in cognitive function (Lee et al., 2008).

In 2018, the UK established the Ministry of Loneliness, signaling that loneliness is no longer solely an individual issue but one that requires national management. Since 2016, the UK has implemented the Social Prescribing system within the NHS. Social prescribing is a system where individuals experiencing mental and emotional difficulties are provided with non-pharmacological help or services available in the community through Link Workers, rather than medication prescriptions (Drinkwater, Wildman, & Moffatt, 2019). Social prescribing primarily targets various individuals, including those needing mental health support or those who are lonely or isolated. A Link Worker is a new professional role that connects patients prescribed social activities by a GP to community organizations implementing these activities and manages the patient. The system aims to alleviate or prevent symptoms through social activities, rather than relying solely on pharmacological treatment for disease management. Activation of social prescribing could potentially alleviate the financial burden on GPs and the NHS. Moreover, the NHS Long Term Plan presents social prescribing as a core component for implementing Universal Personalized Care (NHS England, 2018).

In South Korea, on November 24, 2022, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Regional Welfare Division, under the Welfare Administration Support Office, announced policies for preventing solitary deaths as part of measures to support and improve conditions for those in welfare blind spots (MOHW, 2022). While the Korean government has begun developing and promoting policies in this area, specific programs for preventing solitary deaths have yet to be presented concretely.

Following this trend, the Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center initiated a social prescribing pilot project targeting rural areas in Wonju-si starting in 2019. This pilot project demonstrated effectiveness, including reduced depression among experimental group elderly, improved self-esteem, revitalization through intergenerational exchange, and expansion of social relationships (Song, Jo, & Nam, 2019). Research also showed increased social participation attitude scores and self-esteem through the program (Kim et al., 2021). Furthermore, a social prescribing program utilizing a digital platform during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in positive changes in depression, perceived social support, and life satisfaction, along with the effect of expanding social networks (Yoon et al., 2022). However, previous social prescribing studies had limitations in evaluating effectiveness due to small participant numbers. Building on existing domestic research primarily focused on depression, this study aims to investigate whether social prescribing was also effective for cognitive function and loneliness, alongside depression.

Therefore, this study seeks to confirm the improvement effects on depression, cognitive function, and loneliness before and after a social prescribing pilot project conducted from 2021 to 2022 targeting elderly residents in rural areas of Wonju-si. Through this, it aims to present evidence regarding the effectiveness of the community-based social prescribing pilot project.

II. Methods

1. Research Design

This study was conducted to investigate the impact of the social prescribing program, as an intervention, on participants' depression, cognitive function, and loneliness. To confirm the improvement effects on depression, cognitive function, and loneliness before and after the social prescribing pilot project, a Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design was employed, examining the treatment effects on the experimental group participating in the social prescribing program versus the non-participating control group. Following baseline surveys, participants meeting specific criteria were selected. Both experimental and control groups underwent post-intervention evaluations. This study utilized pre-post evaluation data from the social prescribing pilot project conducted by the Yonsei University Healthy City Research Center from April 2021 to October 2022 for analysis.

2. Research Area

The study areas were Heungeup-myeon and Munmak-eup in Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. As of August 2022, examining the aging rate by province/metropolitan city reveals that Gangwon-do, the research area, ranks 4th highest among the 17 regions (Jeollanam-do (24.9%), Gyeongsangbuk-do (23.5%), Jeollabuk-do (22.9%), Gangwon-do (22.4%)). Furthermore, Wonju-si's Heungeup-myeon and Munmak-eup exhibit high aging rates, both having entered super-aged society status with rates of 21.1% and 20.7%, respectively.

3. Study Participants

1) Participant Selection Criteria
The experimental and control groups consisted of elderly individuals aged 65 and over residing in Heungeup-myeon and Munmak-eup, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. Selection criteria were threefold: First, recommendation by at least one local professional (social worker, local primary care physician, or local primary health care post nurse) confirming no issues with participation in the pilot project. Second, capability for routine communication and absence of hearing or visual impairments. Third, a score of 10 or less on the Short-form Geriatric Depression Scale-Korean Version (SGDS-K) during the baseline survey, indicating absence of severe depressive symptoms.

2) Number of Participants
The required sample size was calculated using G*Power 3.1, assuming an effect size of 0.5, power of 0.95, and significance level of .05, resulting in a minimum required sample of 54. Participants were recruited using convenience sampling from a local small library and an elderly welfare center in Wonju-si, surveying 137 individuals. Among the baseline survey participants, 76 who expressed willingness to participate in the intervention program were assigned to the experimental group, and 61 unwilling to participate were assigned to the control group. However, individuals with less than 50% attendance during the intervention program were excluded from the experimental group (final n=75), and 5 individuals from the control group who did not respond to the post-survey were excluded (final n=56). Thus, data from a total of 131 participants were used for the final analysis.

4. Data Collection Method

Data for this study were collected through one-on-one surveys conducted by a total of 7 researchers (6 specializing in health sciences, 1 in preventive medicine). Surveys were administered twice, before and after the intervention. The questionnaire comprised questions measuring socio-demographic indicators, depression, cognitive function, and loneliness. Surveys were conducted only after explaining the survey details to the participants, ensuring they understood the content, and obtaining their consent. The average survey time was approximately 15-20 minutes per elderly participant.

5. Research Variables and Measurement

1) Selection of Research Variables
Previous research indicates that higher loneliness is associated with an increased probability of developing depression over time, and the mental health level of elderly living alone is significantly poorer compared to general elderly (Han & Lee, 2009). Similar findings show that elderly without a spouse have a higher risk of depression compared to those with a spouse (Kim et al., 2015). Additionally, a study targeting rural elderly found that literacy significantly impacts mental health (Ahn, Kim, & Ma, 2021). Given the characteristic of rural areas where illiteracy or low literacy persists, it was judged that this could influence the intervention effects of the social prescribing program. Subjective health status is known to affect the mental health of the elderly (Yeum & Jung, 2014). Whether individuals perceive their health status positively or negatively partially reflects their mental health state, hence it was selected as a control variable. Furthermore, the subjective economic status of elderly living alone affects mental health (Choi, 2008), and elderly receiving financial support from family showed greater life satisfaction (Park, 2000).

Based on these prior studies and the opinions of two local community experts, this study selected age, sex, literacy, religion, presence of spouse, living alone status, subjective health status, subjective economic level, and source of allowance/living expenses as control variables. Depression, cognitive function, and loneliness were selected as dependent variables to measure the effectiveness of the pilot project.

2) Measurement of Research Variables
Participants' depression levels were measured using the Short-form Geriatric Depression Scale-Korean Version (SGDS-K). Higher scores indicate higher levels of depression, with a score range of 0-15. In SGDS-K, scores of 0-5 are considered normal, 6-9 indicate moderate depressive symptoms, and 10 or above indicate depression. In this study, the reliability (Cronbach’s α) was .80, and the validity (KMO measure) was .75.

Participants' cognitive function was measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination Korean Version (MMSE-K). Reliability (Cronbach’s α) in this study was .83.

Participants' loneliness was measured using the UCLA Loneliness Scale Short Form (ULS-8). It consists of 8 items, with a total score of 32. Higher scores indicate experiencing loneliness. In this study, reliability (Cronbach’s α) was .83, and validity (KMO measure) was .78.

6. Intervention Program

1) Intervention Tool
Examples from various countries show a diversity of intervention programs within social prescribing. Since it serves as a means for healthcare professionals to link patients with non-medical community service providers for their well-being and health, various programs can be linked. The social prescribing program used in this study was the Music Storytelling (MST) program.

The Music Storytelling program is a tool that uses music therapy techniques to discover inner stories and lead towards a better life. It aims to restore self-esteem and foster hope and vision for life through self-reflection. The MST program comprises activities designed to enhance 7 domains (cognitive, sensory, language, physical, self, mind-body, intimacy). Furthermore, the MST program received a service mark registration from the Korean Intellectual Property Office in 2013 (Registration No. 41-0270261). The MST program consists of three sessions: RFL (Rhythm for Life), MIC (Movement Improvisation Circle), and GIM (Guided Imagery and Music). The RFL session primarily deals with music therapy, the MIC session includes health and flower tea classes, and the GIM session involves kalimba classes.

In the MIC session's health and flower tea program, participants drink tea brewed from edible flowers to aid mind-body relaxation. Making and tasting flower tea together facilitates communication and expands social networks. Additionally, the program involves various experiences like making snacks using other ingredients along with flowers.

The GIM session features kalimba instrument performance. The kalimba, an instrument originating from Africa, is played using only the thumbs. Plucking the keys downwards with both thumbs produces sound. As the scales are not arranged sequentially, learning it is beneficial for brain activity, suitable for children or the elderly.

2) Intervention Program Structure
The Music Storytelling program was structured over 8 weeks, with three 30-minute sessions conducted once per week. Weeks 1 & 2 RFL sessions involved butterfly breathing and cup percussion (1) to stabilize the mind and body through breathing and enhance cognitive function by learning rhythm through cup percussion. Week 1 MIC session included explanations about flower tea and tea ceremony tools. The GIM session introduced the kalimba, explaining its origin, types, and instrument parts. Week 2 MIC session introduced various colors of flower tea and explained the meanings associated with colors. The GIM session taught how to hold and play the kalimba using both thumbs. Weeks 3 & 4 RFL sessions taught breathing methods along with handbell playing, learning sequences and pitch by playing together. Week 3 MIC session involved making and tasting beverages using flowers, fostering intimacy with neighbors. The GIM session taught playing the song 'Airplane' using 3 notes on the kalimba. Week 4 MIC session involved making songpyeon (rice cakes) using flowers. The GIM session reviewed 'Airplane' and taught 'Butterfly,' a song playable with 5 notes. Weeks 5 & 6 RFL sessions taught breathing methods and playing the small drum (sogo) along with music. Week 5 MIC session involved making and tasting flower candy using pansies. The GIM session reviewed 5-note songs and taught 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,' playable with 8 notes. Week 6 MIC session involved learning about oils derived from flowers and experiencing oil therapy. The GIM session reviewed previously learned songs and taught 'Ode to Joy.' Week 7 RFL session activated physical function and enhanced peer intimacy through proper walking and stretching. The MIC session involved learning about and practicing tea aroma therapy (chahun). The GIM session reviewed all previously learned songs in preparation for the music concert in week 8. Week 8 RFL session involved choir singing to music and making percussion instruments. The MIC session focused on learning about flower scents and fragrance therapy. The GIM session involved performing previously learned songs in front of others.

3) Intervention Method
The program was conducted by 3 Music Storytelling program experts once a week, with each session lasting 30 minutes. University student volunteers were included in each session. These student volunteers were from three local universities and local alternative middle/high schools. Student volunteers received pre-training about the program before its implementation.

4) Intervention Location
Program locations included community institutions near participants' residences in Heungeup-myeon, such as a small library, senior centers, and village management offices.

7. Statistical Analysis

Collected data were analyzed using the statistical program SPSS Statistics ver. 26.0 with the following methods:
First, percentages and frequency analysis were conducted to understand the socio-demographic characteristics, depression, cognitive function, and loneliness levels of the research participants.
Second, T-tests and Chi-square tests were performed on all measurement variables (socio-demographic indicators, depression, cognitive function, loneliness) to verify homogeneity between the experimental and control groups.
Third, Paired t-tests and Independent t-tests were conducted to determine if there were significant differences in depression, cognitive function, and loneliness scores before and after the intervention.
Fourth, simple Difference-in-Differences (DID) analysis and multiple DID analysis were performed to examine if there were significant differences in the changes in depression, cognitive function, and loneliness between the experimental and control groups.

8. Ethical Considerations

Before conducting the survey, researchers explained the purpose of data collection and usage to the participants. They promised to maintain participants' anonymity in all research data utilization and obtained consent for data use. This study received IRB approval from the Yonsei University Mirae Campus Institutional Review Board (1041849-202206-SB-105-01).

III. Research Results

1. Characteristics of Participants

Analysis of the socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants revealed an average age of 79.71 years (SD=6.51). Among the 137 total participants [translator's note: likely should be 131 based on exclusion criteria], 12 (8.8%) were male and 125 (91.2%) were female. 110 participants (80.3%) were literate, while 27 (19.7%) were not. The most common religions were Protestantism and No religion (46 each, 33.6%), followed by Buddhism (32, 23.4%) and Catholicism (11, 8.0%). 74 participants (54.4%) did not have a spouse, while 65 (45.6%) did. 71 (51.8%) were living alone, and 65 (47.4%) lived with cohabitants. Regarding subjective health status, 'bad' was the most frequent response (45, 32.8%), followed by 'moderate' (37, 27.0%), 'good' (28, 20.4%), 'very bad' (23, 16.8%), and 'very good' (4, 2.9%). When asked about subjective economic level, 'lower' was the most common answer (70, 51.1%), followed by 'middle' (65, 47.4%), and 'upper' (2, 1.5%). The most common source of allowance and living expenses was basic living security benefits (38, 27.7%), followed by pension or retirement allowance (35, 25.5%), earned income (28, 20.4%), children's help (15, 10.9%), property income or rent (11, 8.0%), and others (10, 7.3%).

Analyzing clinical indicators, the average depression score was 5.87 (SD=3.8) out of 15, and the average cognitive function score was 25.4 (SD=3.84) out of 30.
Analyzing social indicators, the average loneliness score was 17.81 (SD=6.95) out of 32.

2. Results of Homogeneity Test between Experimental and Control Groups

T-tests and Chi-square tests were performed before the social prescribing pilot project implementation to assess the homogeneity between the experimental and control groups regarding socio-demographic, clinical, and social indicator variables &lt;Table 2>.

The average age was 80.18 years (SD=6.32) for the experimental group and 79.13 years (SD=6.74) for the control group. Both groups had a higher proportion of females; 72 (94.7%) in the experimental group were female, and 4 (5.3%) were male. In the control group, 53 (86.9%) were female, and 8 (13.1%) were male. 61 participants (80.3%) in the experimental group and 49 (80.3%) in the control group were literate. Protestantism was the most common religion in the experimental group (29, 38.2%), while No religion was most common in the control group (21, 34.4%). Both groups had a lower proportion of participants with spouses; 41 (53.9%) in the experimental group were without a spouse, and 35 (46.1%) had one. In the control group, 34 (55.7%) were without a spouse, and 27 (44.3%) had one. 37 participants (48.6%) in the experimental group lived alone, while 39 (51.3%) lived with cohabitants. In the control group, 35 (27.4%) lived alone, and 26 (42.6%) lived with cohabitants. The most common subjective health status response was 'bad' for both groups (Experimental: 26, 34.2%; Control: 19, 31.1% - note discrepancy with text above). The most common subjective economic level was 'lower' for both groups (Experimental: 38, 50.0%; Control: 32, 52.5%). The most common source of income was basic living security benefits for both groups (Experimental: 20, 26.3%; Control: 18, 29.6%). No statistically significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups for any socio-demographic indicators.

The average depression score was 6.56 (SD=3.50) for the experimental group and 5.14 (SD=4.04) for the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in depression scores between the groups (t=2.556, p=.012).
The cognitive function score was 25.41 (SD=3.35) for the experimental group and 25.67 (SD=4.07) for the control group, showing no statistically significant difference (t=.657, p=.512).
The average loneliness score was 15.09 (SD=5.14) for the experimental group and 16.83 (SD=5.67) for the control group, with no statistically significant difference found (t=0.471, p=.106; note t-value appears low for this p-value, likely error in original text or calculation).

In summary, the experimental and control groups showed no significant differences in socio-demographic indicators, cognitive function, or loneliness, but did show a significant difference in baseline depression scores.

3. Evaluation Results of the Social Prescribing Pilot Project's Intervention Effect

1) Results of Simple Difference-in-Differences (DID) Analysis on Clinical and Social Indicators
The results of the simple DID analysis on clinical and social indicators for the experimental and control groups after the social prescribing program intervention are shown in &lt;Table 3>.

The experimental group's depression score significantly decreased from a pre-test average of 6.56 (SD=3.50) to a post-test average of 5.51 (SD=3.45) (p=.007). The control group's depression score increased from a pre-test average of 5.14 (SD=4.04) to a post-test average of 5.25 (SD=4.23), but this increase was not statistically significant (p=.735). The simple DID analysis result indicated that the experimental group's depression score decreased by 1.14 points more than the control group's change.

The experimental group's cognitive function score significantly increased from a pre-test average of 25.41 (SD=3.35) to a post-test average of 26.24 (SD=3.39) (p=.004). The control group's cognitive function score increased from a pre-test average of 25.67 (SD=4.07) to a post-test average of 26.03 (SD=4.16), but this increase was not statistically significant (p=.395). The simple DID analysis result indicated that the experimental group's cognitive function score increased by 0.254 points more than the control group's change.

(Table 3. Results of simple DID analysis on clinical and social indicator - Assumed to be provided in English with details)

The experimental group's loneliness score significantly decreased from a pre-test average of 15.09 (SD=5.14) to a post-test average of 12.67 (SD=4.05) (p&lt;.001). The control group's loneliness score increased from a pre-test average of 16.83 (SD=5.67) to a post-test average of 17.02 (SD=5.69), but this increase was not statistically significant (p=.077 - note discrepancy with table value p&lt;.05 implies significance, likely error in text). The simple DID analysis result indicated that the experimental group's loneliness score decreased by 2.101 points more than the control group's change.

In summary, the simple DID analysis showed that the pre-post score changes for depression, cognitive function, and loneliness were greater in the experimental group compared to the control group.

2) Results of Multiple Difference-in-Differences (DID) Analysis on Clinical and Social Indicators

&lt;Table 4> presents the results of the multiple DID analysis testing the intervention effect on clinical and social indicators, controlling for covariates.

Analyzing the depression score as the outcome variable, the time variable was not statistically significant. However, the group variable was statistically significant (B=1.307, p=.030), and the interaction term showed significance in the negative direction (B=-1.658, p=.039). This confirms the intervention's effect on the change in depression in the experimental group. Among socio-demographic characteristics, having a religion (B=-1.543, p=.001), having good subjective health status (B=-2.797, p&lt;.001), and having a high subjective economic level (B=-3.375, p=.045) were associated with significantly lower depression scores.

Analyzing cognitive function as the outcome variable, the time variable, group variable, and interaction term were all statistically non-significant. This confirms that the intervention did not have an effect on the change in cognitive function in the experimental group. Among socio-demographic characteristics, higher age was associated with significantly lower cognitive function (B=-0.159, p&lt;.001), while having literacy (B=2.275, p&lt;.001) and good subjective health status (B=1.264, p=.005) were associated with significantly higher cognitive function.

(Table 4. Results of multiple DID analysis on clinical and social indicator - Assumed to be provided in English with details)

Analyzing loneliness as the outcome variable, both the time and group variables were statistically non-significant. The interaction term was significantly negative (B=-1.399, p=.032 - note discrepancy with table value B=-3.029, p&lt;.05). This confirms the intervention's effect on the change in loneliness in the experimental group. Among socio-demographic characteristics, higher age was associated with significantly lower loneliness (B=-0.127, p=.034). Having literacy (B=-1.840, p=.045) and having a religion (B=-2.116, p=.011) were also associated with significantly lower loneliness.

The multiple DID analysis results, showing statistically significant interaction terms for depression and loneliness, indicate that the intervention through this social prescribing program was effective for both depression and loneliness.

IV. Discussion

This study employed a non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest design and Difference-in-Differences (DID) analysis to evaluate the intervention effects of a social prescribing program conducted in a rural area of Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. A control group was selected from the same region as the experimental group, and pre-post survey data were collected from both groups using the same questionnaire and administered to the same individuals. This approach aimed to control for regional and individual characteristics and verify the effectiveness of the intervention.

DID analysis is applicable when there are experimental and control groups, and distinct pre- and post-intervention time points. It identifies the net effect of the intervention by subtracting the change in the outcome variable in the control group from the change in the experimental group. Numerous domestic and international studies have used DID analysis to evaluate healthcare policy effects (Kwon, Cho, & Ko, 2011; Choi & Jung, 2012; Farrar et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2021), and it is also utilized for evaluating community-based health project effects (Lee, Jo, & Nam, 2019; Lee, So, Lee, & Nam, 2020). A UK study also used DID analysis to evaluate the effects of a social prescribing program for patients with type 2 diabetes (Wildman & Wildman, 2021).

Research on social prescribing in the UK suggests it can act as a complement to clinical treatment for depression (Fancourt, Opher, & de Oliveira, 2020) and helps improve physical and mental health (Chatterjee, Camic, Lockyer, & Thomson, 2018). The Glasgow Deep End Link Worker RCT study found significantly better improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms among those who saw a Link Worker at least twice compared to the control group (Mercer et al., 2017). Additionally, social prescribing pilot projects conducted in Korea also reported reduced depression (Song et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2022). Consistent with these previous findings, the experimental group participating in the social prescribing program in this study showed a statistically significant reduction in depression. Since social prescribing was developed in the UK to address mental health issues through social activity rather than solely medication, it is considered that participation led to reduced depression in the experimental group. The social prescribing program in this study ran once a week for 8 weeks. During this period, participation provided an opportunity to escape the monotonous routine of rural life, meet people, talk, and engage in new activities and learning. This aligns with previous research showing that social interaction with people reduces depression (Rotenberg & Hamel, 1988). Furthermore, interactions with different generations, such as instructors and student volunteers, are known to improve quality of life (Chung, Chung, & Kim, 2016), which likely contributed to the reduction in depression, consistent with prior studies.

Studies indicate that depression is stronger among non-religious elderly compared to religious elderly (Kim, 2022). Other research also suggests that individuals without religious affiliation have a higher risk of depression compared to those affiliated. High levels of religious participation, organizational religious involvement, religious salience, and intrinsic religious motivation reduce the risk of depressive symptoms and disorders, implying that religious involvement may exert a protective effect against the incidence and persistence of depression (McCullough & Larson, 1999). This study also found reduced depression among elderly with religious beliefs. This result seems consistent with prior research, suggesting that religion facilitates social activity and intrinsic religious motivation reduces depression.

In this study, better subjective health status was associated with reduced depression. Previous research has shown that subjective health status influences depression (Hur & Yoo, 2002), and a close relationship exists between subjective health status and depression (Park, Park, Yang, & Chung, 2016). Good physical condition may lead to increased leisure activities and social contact, reducing depression, whereas poor condition might decrease social activity frequency, leading to depression. Also, declining health status due to aging could contribute to depression in the elderly.

According to previous research, lower subjective economic level is significantly associated with higher levels of depression and suicidal ideation (Han & Song, 2021). This aligns with our finding that depression decreased among those with higher subjective economic levels. Consistent with other studies (Imai et al., 2015), subjective economic level acts as a contributing factor to depressive state or psychological condition, which could lead to deterioration of physical and mental health in the elderly. In a similar vein, our results showed that when income sources were pension or basic living security benefits, depression increased. Family assistance is known to include economic support along with family care and support (Park, 2000). Our findings did not align with previous research suggesting that children's financial support increases elderly depression (Park, Park, & Yum, 2015). However, research supporting our finding that family financial support reduces elderly depression noted that elderly receiving informal care from family or relatives had higher life satisfaction than those receiving formal government care like long-term care (Lee, 2021).

Elderly depression and loneliness have a significant correlation, and higher loneliness is known to lead to the manifestation of depressive symptoms (Aylaz, Aktürk, Erci, Öztürk, & Aslan, 2012). Loneliness is also associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, depression, cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease (Valtorta, Kanaan, Gilbody, Ronzi, & Hanratty, 2016). Mental health issues related to loneliness and isolation are likely to decrease through social prescribing (Fridli, Jackson, Abernethy, & Stansfield, 2008; South, Higgins, Woodall, & White, 2008). Indeed, an analysis of social prescribing programs implemented in the UK from 2014 to 2019 found reduced loneliness (Reinhardt, Vidovic, & Hammerton., 2021). Moreover, providing tailored programs to the elderly through social prescribing is more likely to yield positive effects on loneliness and social isolation (Gardiner, Geldenhuys, & Gott, 2018). Consistent with this, our study confirmed that loneliness decreased among the elderly participants through social prescribing. As mentioned earlier, depression and loneliness are correlated, so it is inferred that loneliness decreased alongside depression. Previous research suggests that social activity and depression are risk factors for loneliness, and improving social activities is necessary to reduce loneliness (Lee et al., 2019). This aligns with our finding that participation in the intervention program's social activities reduced both depression and loneliness.   

This study found that higher age was associated with reduced loneliness. This contradicts previous research indicating that loneliness increases with age (Yang & Victor, 2011). The increase in loneliness is reportedly due less to aging itself and more to increased physical disability and reduced social activity (Jylhä, 2004). However, other research aligns with our finding that loneliness decreased with age (Djukanović, Sorjonen, & Peterson, 2015). Characteristics of rural areas, such as a culture of respecting and caring for older elderly, and the likelihood of older individuals having lived in the area longer, might explain why higher age was associated with reduced loneliness in this study.

According to previous research, the link between illiteracy and loneliness stems from chronic stress and limited social networks (Zhong, Liu, Chen, Chiu, & Conwell, 2018). Another study found that illiteracy significantly impacts physical health, exercise habits, anxiety, loneliness, and happiness (Zhang, 2021). Similar to prior studies, our research showed that higher literacy was associated with reduced loneliness. Lower literacy likely reduces social contact through people and limits social networks, hence higher literacy is thought to reduce loneliness.

This study found that having a religion was associated with reduced loneliness, consistent with previous research showing less loneliness with higher participation in religious activities (Johnson & Mullins, 1989). Therefore, the presence of religion was significant for both depression and loneliness, suggesting that religious activity is social in nature, and intrinsic religious motivation likely influences both depression and loneliness.

While the experimental group's cognitive function improved somewhat after the pilot project and was statistically significant within the group, the comparison with the control group (DID analysis) showed no significant intervention effect. The slight improvement in the experimental group is thought to be due to the social prescribing program activating cognitive functions through learning new instruments, rhythms, or memory tasks. However, the evaluation of the intervention effect on cognitive function improvement did not show a statistically significant change post-intervention. This finding contrasts with research on cognitive function in elderly participating in social activities (Laurin, Verreault, Lindsay, MacPherson, & Rockwood., 2001; Verghese, Holtzer, Lipton, & Wang, 2009) and results showing reduced age-related diseases, including dementia, from social prescribing interventions (Baker & Irving, 2016). It is thought that the 8-week duration might have been too short to improve cognitive function significantly. Future social prescribing programs aiming for dementia prevention may need to consider the duration alongside these findings.

Although no significant intervention effect on cognitive function was found, associations were observed between age, literacy, subjective health status, and cognitive function. Specifically, higher age was associated with decreased cognitive function, consistent with numerous prior studies (Glisky, 2007; Deary et al., 2009). Literacy was associated with increased cognitive function, also aligning with previous research; although compensatory scoring might be given in cognitive tests for illiteracy, fundamental learning ability is lower, likely contributing to reduced cognitive function in illiterate participants (Vágvölgyi, Coldea, Dresler, Schrader, & Nuerk, 2016). Prior studies showed a significant correlation between subjective health status and cognitive function (Park et al., 2016), and another found higher cognitive function with higher health perception (Park, Ko, & Lee, 2012). Our study, consistent with these findings, showed that participants who perceived their health as high also had higher cognitive function.

The limitations of this study are as follows. First, propensity score matching, commonly used before DID analysis in prior research to ensure baseline homogeneity, was not performed. Matching eliminates unmatched individuals, reducing the overall sample size. Given the initial sample sizes (Exp=75, Con=56), matching could have reduced the number of participants available for intervention effect analysis, potentially hindering effect verification or reducing result accuracy. While this is a limitation, homogeneity tests were conducted, and individual socio-demographic characteristics were included as variables in the DID regression model to control for potential confounding factors and accurately measure the intervention effect, mitigating this limitation to some extent. Previous social prescribing research highlights difficulties in participant recruitment and attrition affecting pre-post evaluation (Bickerdike, Booth, Wilson, Farley, & Wright, 2017; Husk, Elston, Gradinger, Callaghan, & Asthana, 2019).
Second, potential selection bias might exist. The experimental group consisted of individuals prescribed the social prescribing program, while the control group comprised those not prescribed. Since group assignment was based on willingness to participate rather than randomization, individuals with higher interest in social activities and more favorable attitudes might have been disproportionately selected.
Third, while intervention study guidelines like Duncan et al. (2020) and SPIRIT were consulted, not all recommendations could be fully reflected in the actual study design and implementation.
Fourth, although this intervention study received institutional IRB approval, clinical research including interventions should ideally be registered with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency's Clinical Research Information Service (CRIS) for public disclosure of research information, which was not done in this study. Future intervention studies should aim for registration with CRIS in addition to institutional IRB approval before implementation.
Fifth, the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic might not have been fully controlled. The pandemic significantly impacted mental health ('Corona Blue'), and temporal differences affecting participants were not controlled, requiring consideration in future research.
Sixth, this study analyzed the effects over an 8-week period, making it difficult to ascertain long-term trends or the sustainability of the intervention effects. Additionally, the relatively small sample sizes for both groups might limit representativeness, thus hindering the generalizability of the findings.

V. Conclusion

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a social prescribing pilot project intervention on participants' depression, cognitive function, and loneliness among rural elderly. Based in Heungeup-myeon and Munmak-eup, highly aged areas within Wonju-si, Gangwon-do, the community-based social prescribing program intervention was confirmed to be effective in improving participants' clinical indicator (depression) and social indicator (loneliness). The conclusions drawn from this study are as follows:

First, this study confirmed that the social prescribing program intervention conducted in a rural area was effective in reducing depression and loneliness in the experimental group. This suggests that community-based social prescribing is effective for promoting the mental and social health of the elderly. Therefore, its potential utility as part of the currently promoted community integrated care projects was confirmed.

Second, social prescribing activities, such as music activities, flower tea making, and gardening, were confirmed to potentially promote activities beneficial for participants' mental and physical health. Such activities utilize various community resources and suggest a potential for community revitalization.

Third, since the social prescribing system involves not only healthcare professionals but also community experts and residents, establishing a Korean-style social prescribing system requires developing new professional roles like Link Workers and discussing the introduction of a sustainable social prescribing system.

Fourth, considering the Korean government's recent policy direction towards preventing solitary deaths, the results of this study suggest that community-based social prescribing programs can be utilized in various projects, such as depression improvement management initiatives.

A Study on the Application of Community Care in Social Prescribing

Abstract: This study aims to provide basic practical and policy data for the establishment and spread of an community care system in Korea. Through literature research, the social prescribing in the UK and the community care service model in Korea were explored, and the components were analyzed. Components were social prescribers, link worker, referrals. This study will contribute to the stable establishment and spread of community care and social prescribing by suggesting the direction of community care by expanding the participation of doctors who are social prescribers, fostering social prescribing-link worker, and establishing a database of referrals.

I. Introduction

South Korea's elderly population, corresponding to the adult vulnerable group, is projected to increase rapidly from 20.3% in 2025 to 43.9% in 2060 (Statistics Korea, 2022). Along with the increase in the elderly population, the prevalence of chronic diseases attributable to lifestyle habits is also rising, predicting a rapid increase in future disease burden and medical expenses (Hong Seok-cheol et al., 2023). Thus, under a low-growth trend, population aging acts as a risk factor for the fiscal soundness and sustainability of the health insurance system (Kim Gyu-dong et al., 2023; Kim Jun-kyung & Kim Jun-il, 2021; Han Jong-sun, 2021).

Single-person households in Korea are increasing rapidly, with the proportion of single-person households among all households projected to increase from 31.2% (6.48 million households) in 2020 to 39.6% (9.05 million households) by 2050. This raises concerns about issues of loneliness and alienation within communities due to the increase in residents with severed relationships (Kang Seon-kyung & Lee Chun-hee, 2023; Jeon Bo-young et al., 2022). Recently, phenomena such as suicide, alcohol problems, and drug addiction, similar to those in Western societies, are also emerging as social problems. The suicide rate is 24.6 per 100,000 people, 2.2 times the OECD average, ranking first among OECD member countries (Kang Seon-kyung & Lee Chun-hee, 2023; Jeong Yun-hee & Kim Hee-jeong, 2020). Suicide is discussed in connection with 'social despair' (Jang Sook-rang, 2021). This is primarily caused by psychological and mental difficulties, and is significantly influenced by social and economic factors (Park Hyeong-min & Lee Eun-ju, 2014; Ministry of Health and Welfare & Korea Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2022). Decreased life satisfaction among the elderly, along with job or economic worries among young or middle-aged adults, leads to health disparities (Kim Gyu-dong et al., 2023; Han Jong-sun, 2021), making the establishment of a national safety net urgent (Kim Mi-sook, 2023).

Due to rapid societal changes such as swift aging, shifts in disease structure including chronic diseases, and alienation caused by relationship severance, the number of people facing economic, physical, emotional, and social problems is increasing. Consequently, care, previously considered a private matter, is rapidly shifting into the social domain (Kim Il-ho et al., 2024). Therefore, in response to the growing demand for the socialization of care and the need for expanded public responsibility, South Korea promoted the establishment of a comprehensive community care plan, announcing the 'Community Integrated Care Basic Plan' jointly with relevant ministries in November 2018. Subsequently, starting with pilot projects in 2019, the goal is to establish the foundation for providing community integrated care by 2025 (Kim Soo-jin & Choi Seong-moon, 2022; Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2021). Furthermore, various attempts are recently being made to expand opportunities for service users to participate in community activities and encourage communities to engage with vulnerable individuals (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2021). Now is the time when diverse approaches are needed for the success of the community integrated care policy.

In this context, we need to pay attention to the UK's 'social prescribing.' 'Social prescribing,' which the UK National Health Service (NHS) is expanding nationwide through the 'NHS long-term plan (2019),' is evaluated as contributing not only to the mental and physical health of diverse beneficiary groups but also to improving quality of life and enhancing community resilience (Joo Hana et al., 2023). It is also known to have positive effects on alleviating the burden on the community healthcare system (Nam Hae-kwon et al., 2020; Seol Dong-young et al., 2022; Song Geu-reum et al., 2019; Jo Hye-yeon et al., 2023; Choi Bo-yeon, 2019; Han Jong-sun, 2021; Orangecross, 2022). In the UK, as mental health issues like loneliness and depression, as well as suicide, became prominent social problems, especially among the elderly, social prescribing through linkage between community organizations and medical professionals is being expanded. The aim is to resolve issues of loneliness and alienation through strengthening social relationships via cultural and leisure activities, so-called 'connecting society' (Kang Mi-hwa et al., 2021; Jang Se-gil et al., 2023).

Given the rapid social structural changes in Korea, the nation might face serious care issues even before community integrated care is fully established (Lee Eun-kyung, 2022). Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and reflect on the prior experiences and policies of developed countries that entered aging societies earlier, and benchmark them. Accordingly, in a reality where prior research on social prescribing is lacking, this study aims to provide basic practical and policy data for the stable establishment and spread of the community integrated care system by analyzing the components of the initial stages of social prescribing and exploring its applicability to community integrated care.

II. Theoretical Background and Literature Review

1. Community Integrated Care

Community Integrated Care is a region-led social service policy ensuring integrated provision of housing, health & medical care, long-term care, personal care, and independent living support, enabling residents needing care due to aging, accidents, or illness who wish to stay in their usual place (own home, group home, etc.) to live there while receiving services tailored to their individual needs and engaging with the community (Kim Soo-jin & Choi Seong-moon, 2022; Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2021). Countries experiencing rapid aging, such as the UK and Japan, prioritize community-based home care services. The UK, which entered an aging society in 1976, introduced community care through the 'NHS and Community Care Act' in 1990 and has achieved continuous development since. Japan also introduced the comprehensive regional care system through the revision of the 'Long-term Care Insurance Act' in 2005 to enable the elderly to lead self-determined lives within the community (Lee Eun-kyung, 2022). This allows the elderly, previously treated solely as care recipients, to live while preserving their dignity and independence by staying in their homes or regions and activating local interactions.

Currently, Korea's Community Integrated Care pilot projects prioritize linking and providing national care services, supplemented by additional care services developed independently by local governments as needed. The aim is to discover services suitable for local conditions, verify and refine provision models, and develop diverse community care models. The 추진 direction emphasizes 'maximizing local autonomy, creativity, and diversity,' 'maximizing input and utilization of local resources and capabilities,' 'operating as a co-created project,' and 'maximizing project effects by simultaneously conducting various linked projects' (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2021).

Specifically, the government announced the 'Community Integrated Care Basic Plan' jointly with relevant ministries in November 2018 to facilitate community-centered social services. The Ministry of Health and Welfare introduced 'Community Integrated Care' as a region-led social service policy that comprehensively supports housing, health & medical care, long-term care, personal care, independent living, etc., enabling individuals to receive services tailored to their needs and live together with the community. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family is emphasizing support for forming social networks for single-person households in the 4th Basic Plan for Healthy Families (2021-2025) and the 3rd Basic Plan for Gender Equality Policy (2023-2027), and expanding projects addressing care and intimacy needs through 244 regional Family Centers nationwide. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism is developing and operating the Connecting Society Regional Hub Program, aiming for social relationship recovery by linking individuals not through medication but through communication between people, dense connections between community and individuals, and cultural resources such as humanities, culture/arts, sports, tourism, etc., targeting loneliness and social isolation. Relevant ministries jointly established and are implementing the 1st Basic Plan for Prevention of Solitary Death (2023-2027), promoting four major strategies: development of tools for identifying high-risk groups for solitary death and assessing risk levels, strengthening connections to resolve social isolation, linking services tailored to life cycles, and building a policy foundation for prevention and management of solitary death. Thus, policies emphasizing social networks for resolving social isolation as a response to loneliness, such as 조성ing community spaces promoting connections among residents, establishing support systems through social network formation, and confirming connections and well-being using ICT, are being conceptualized (Jang Se-gil et al., 2023).

For the settlement of Community Integrated Care, which is divided into financial input projects, linked projects, and local government's own projects, establishing a multi-layered system through close cooperation with private institutions in addition to public-led community initiatives must be emphasized (Park Seong-jun, 2019). This requires efficient operation utilizing the community's characteristics and human/material resources to the maximum extent. It is a crucial time to quantitatively predict and evaluate the outcomes of health management projects to plan and operate more effective programs with limited resources (Hong Seok-cheol et al., 2023). Therefore, efforts are needed to actively introduce and disseminate advanced models evaluated as more efficient than reactive treatment in terms of cost and effectiveness by expanding support for preventive health management, such as improving lifestyles or forming social networks for local residents experiencing social, mental, or emotional difficulties.

2. Social Prescribing

'Social Prescribing,' being expanded throughout the UK by the NHS, is a system that helps people experiencing social, mental, or emotional difficulties improve their health and quality of life by enabling them to participate in community programs and interact with each other. It provides non-pharmacological assistance available in the community rather than medication prescriptions, enabling individuals to lead healthy and vibrant lives. That is, primary care physicians or healthcare professionals providing direct care introduce target individuals to social prescribing link workers. Through consultation with the link worker, the patient finds potential solutions and designs personalized remedies (Orangecross, 2022). This is based on the recognition that social determinants impact people's health and quality of life, thus aiming to closely connect community assets with individuals. In other words, for personalized care optimized for each individual, primary care professionals connect patients (target individuals) with non-medical community assets such as arts activities, physical activities, learning, volunteering, social/self-help groups, etc., helping them utilize existing community services or facilities to live healthily in a social context (Kang Mi-hwa et al., 2021; Nam Hae-kwon, 2020).

Social prescribing proceeds through three stages. The first stage is referral (community referrals), where a medical professional refers the target individual with their consent. Most referrals are made through the patient's GP (general practitioner), but medical professionals such as clinic nurses, specialist nurses, cancer consultants, or psychotherapists also refer to link workers. The second stage involves the referred target individual exploring community services through consultation with a link worker. Link workers, also called 'support brokers' or 'community navigators,' propose and support customized social prescriptions for the target individual. They encourage the individual to participate in community activities or start new hobbies, helping them become active members of society. The third stage involves the referred target individual participating in service activities in various local groups. This stage aims to support people in living more independently and enhance the sustainability of care (Jeong Gi-seong, 2018). However, since the groups and institutions available for social prescribing referrals vary by region, the link worker must identify the institutions capable of accepting referrals and the available services in that area beforehand when initiating social prescribing.

In the UK, where research on health disparities has been ongoing since the 1970s, the 'Acheson Report' in 1998 conceptualized the multi-layered social determinants of health (SDH) and promoted measures against health disparities through social reform. As a response to SDH, the service model of 'social prescribing' gained attention. Since the 2000s, UK Department of Health white papers mentioned social prescribing as an approach to promoting health and independence and accessing community services. In 2013, Clinical Commissioning Groups were established to enable medical decisions related to local healthcare to be made by local residents or healthcare professionals close to patients. Through the presentation of the NHS vision in 2014, the importance of 'patient activation support,' 'community participation,' and 'collaboration with the voluntary sector' was emphasized, and social prescribing models were categorized based on the degree of link worker involvement. In 2016, social prescribing was presented as one of the activities to reduce the burden on GPs, showing significant interest and expectation from the government, leading to the establishment of a nationwide network. By 2017, over 100 social prescribing systems were operating nationwide. In 2018, the world's first 'Ministry for Loneliness' was created as part of the national health strategy. Emphasizing social connection to resolve social isolation, primary care physicians implement social prescribing, suggesting social interaction activities like participating in cultural programs or joining clubs instead of medication prescriptions for people complaining of loneliness (Jang Se-gil et al., 2023). The UK's 'NHS long-term plan (2019)' aimed to increase accessibility to social prescribing services intervening for everyone, intending to train and deploy social prescribing link workers in primary care networks nationwide, planning to expand link workers to enable at least 900,000 people to use social prescribing services by 2024 (Orangecross, 2022).

We need to pay attention to the UK's operation of community programs through social prescribing to solve problems and prevent issues for residents experiencing social, mental, or emotional difficulties. Furthermore, interest in the process and outcomes of recently attempted community programs in Korea (Yoon Hye-jin, 2022; Lim Joo-ae et al., 2022; Jo Hye-yeon, 2023) and efforts to graft them onto community integrated care are necessary.

III. Component Analysis

Logic models, utilized to enhance the service quality of social welfare programs or policies and provide optimal benefits to target individuals, present a systematic pathway of input, conversion, output, and outcome. This study focused on the human and material resources of the input stage. The human and material resources constituting the input stage of 'social prescribing' can be identified as social prescribers, link workers, and referral sources. The 'social prescriber' is positioned at the point of contact for social prescribing, introducing the link worker when recognizing the needs of residents with health-related issues. While residents can consult directly with link workers themselves, typically the social prescriber recognizes the resident's needs and contacts the link worker (Orangecross, 2022). The 'link worker' is an essential component of the primary care network collaborative team, playing a pivotal role in social prescribing. The link worker holistically evaluates the resident referred by the social prescriber and connects them with local resources. Based on the target resident's story, the link worker proposes and supports customized social prescriptions. That is, the link worker helps the resident participate in community activities or start new hobbies, assists them in becoming active members of society, provides tailored help for health recovery, or links them with relevant programs to learn skills and find employment (Jeong Gi-seong, 2018). For example, link workers, in collaboration with local hospitals, use therapeutic techniques like gardening in nature as a social prescription for mental health issues, operating gardening and walking programs for residents suffering from depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, etc., enabling participants to experience improved quality of life (Song Geu-reum et al., 2019; Lee Eun-kyung, 2022). The 'referral source' linked by the link worker provides services tailored to improving well-being, health, and resolving social isolation. Referral sources include various institutions or groups related to sports enjoyed individually or collectively, hobbies like music, art, crafts, reading, dance, exercise, gardening, etc., lunch groups, self-help groups, volunteer activities, adult education, vocational training, supported employment activities, advice or counseling, and administration, housing, employment, education, finance, etc. (Baek Ji-eun, 2023; Seol Dong-young et al., 2022).

IV. Conclusion

This study focuses on promoting community environments for residents to sustain their daily lives for extended periods, thereby addressing care needs arising from increased single-person households, reducing risk factors, protecting human dignity, and strengthening social relationships. Therefore, based on the analysis of the input stage components of social prescribing, driven by the need for establishing institutionalized services for the continued residence of care-recipient residents within the community, the conclusions are as follows. First, measures to expand the participation of social prescribers, i.e., physicians, in clinical practice are required. While Korea's community integrated care and the UK's universal care share the characteristic of being medical security systems based on universalism, Korea's community integrated care faces the reality of significantly lower physician participation as social prescribers responsible for primary care compared to the UK. On-site clinical practice by medical professionals needs to be expanded through the introduction of various consultation methods, including non-face-to-face consultations. Second, fostering social prescribing link workers is required. Currently, in Korea's community integrated care, case managers in the welfare domain perform the role of linkage activities. However, as social care has taken on universal characteristics since the 2000s, aiming for community-centered, user-centered, and independence-centered services, the need to reflect the changing identity of professionals in their activities arises. Therefore, fostering experts equipped with community service capabilities through training differentiated from medical professionals is necessary (Park Myeong-ju & Park Eun-kyung, 2023; Yoon Gi-chan & Lee In-soo, 2019; Choi Hyun-soo & Oh Mi-ae, 2017). Third, database construction for referral sources is needed. A system should be built to enable efficient utilization of programs and institutions by sharing information on diverse community resources among consumers, thereby promoting mental health, reducing health inequalities, decreasing demand for medical/welfare system use, and enabling the spread of applied activities reflecting community characteristics. A system for sharing referral source and program resource information, including community human, material, and environmental resources, needs to be established.

Of course, unlike the UK where GPs are central to the universal public healthcare system, Korea relies heavily on private medical care. Therefore, various issues need consideration when actually applying the method of linking patients needing social prescriptions, based on medical professionals' diagnoses, to link workers. However, given that social prescribing is evaluated as having positive effects on the community (Nam Hae-kwon et al., 2020; Seol Dong-young et al., 2022; Song Geu-reum et al., 2019; Jo Hye-yeon et al., 2023; Choi Bo-yeon, 2019; Han Jong-sun, 2021; Orangecross, 2022), attempts to graft it onto community integrated care from various angles are deemed meaningful. Therefore, this study, by exploring ways to apply social prescribing during the implementation phase of the community integrated care pilot project, has limitations in flexibility regarding practical field application. However, by presenting application methods of social prescribing for Korea's community integrated care, this study is expected to contribute to the stable construction and spread of universal integrated care within communities in the future.

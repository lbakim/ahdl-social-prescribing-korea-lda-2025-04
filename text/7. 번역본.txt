Abstract (Korean Translated to English)

This study was conducted to derive implications from the experiences of developed countries, as practical health and social care collaboration measures at the frontline are still lacking in South Korea, despite the government's 2019 announcement of community care expansion to address the complex health and welfare needs of the increasing elderly population in an aging society. To this end, factors influencing collaboration between health and social care at the practical level were analyzed within the context of social prescribing in the UK, which involves cooperation between primary care institutions and community organizations. The research method involved analyzing 23 qualitative and mixed-methods studies related to social prescribing published since 2000, identified using search engines, following the 7 steps of Noblit and Hare's meta-ethnography method for synthesizing and analyzing relevant qualitative research literature. Research findings indicated that barriers to health and social care collaboration included 'lack of shared understanding of the social model of health among health and social care practitioners,' 'lack of trust from primary care professionals towards community organizations,' and 'deficiency in feedback structures between health and social care institutions.' Facilitating factors included 'sufficient time for trust-building,' 'communication opportunities between necessary health and social care practitioners from the initial stages,' and 'trained competency of link workers.' Based on these findings, implications for health and social care collaboration in South Korea were discussed.

I. Introduction

In the 21st century, population aging is treated as one of the crucial factors triggering social change, with much attention focused on formulating policy responses for sustainable development and improving quality of life. In this context, the WHO, through the 'Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (MIPAA)' announced in 2002, urged countries to incorporate the concept of 'active ageing' into their policies in response to the rapid increase in the older population (WHO, 2002). That is, rather than viewing the elderly as dependent subjects in relation to physical frailty and deficiency, it demands a shift in focus towards their active social participation and independent living (Joo et al., 2019). This concept is understood to reflect the experiences of developed countries, which, having undergone the aging process over the past century, realized that sustainable development can only be achieved by proactively preventing dependency stages among the elderly, enabling them to lead independent lives within the community. For example, the UK, which entered an aged society in 1976, introduced community care in the 'NHS and Community Care Act' of 1990 and has continuously developed it. Similarly, Japan, which became an aged society in 1994, introduced the comprehensive regional care system through the revision of the 'Long-term Care Insurance Act' in 2005 to enable the elderly to lead self-determined lives within the community (Lee, 2010a; Yim, 2018).

South Korea, having become an aged society in 2017, initiated the 'Community Integrated Care (Community Care) Leading Project Promotion Plan'*1) in 2019, aiming to establish a universal service provision system by 2026 (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2019a). However, as Korea is expected to enter a super-aged society in 2025, it may face serious aging issues before community care is firmly established in the community. Therefore, preparing a substantial community care policy within a short period is arguably more crucial for Korea compared to other developed countries. As such, it is necessary for Korea to deeply analyze and reflect on the prior experiences and policies of developed countries that entered aged societies decades earlier, learning from their trials and errors and benchmarking excellent policies.

Although the UK entered an aged society about 40 years earlier than Korea in 1976, it is projected to enter a super-aged society around the same time as Korea, in 2026 (Lee, 2020). In the UK, the concept of 'prevention of illness' was introduced in the Seebohm Report back in 1968, even before the start of the aged society. Later, the Griffiths Report 'Community Care: Agenda for Action' (1988) further systematized the preventive perspective within community care, which was then presented in the government white paper 'Caring for People' (1989). Subsequently, the 'NHS and Community Care Act' was enacted in 1990, and community care policies emphasizing prevention have been progressively developed (King’s Fund, 2006). Since then, the UK government has continuously implemented community-centered, individualized service provision policies focused on preventing the onset of conditions requiring long-term care or delaying their occurrence as much as possible. This policy direction aligns with the vision of the UK Department of Health and Social Care (2018), encapsulated in the slogan 'Prevention is Better than Cure.' The NHS*2) also announced the 'Five Year Forward View' (2014), outlining its vision for the next five years towards prevention, integration, and community services. Based on this, in 2015, the NHS launched 44 Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs) through a nationwide local government application process. Social prescribing, which gained attention for its positive effects during STP evaluations, is being expanded nationwide through the subsequent 'NHS Long Term Plan' (2019) (King’s Fund, 2020).

Social prescribing can be seen as a new approach focusing on collaboration between primary care and community organizations within the community (Pescheny et al., 2018). Also known as Community Referrals, social prescribing is a model where a General Practitioner (GP**3)) refers patients who require non-medical services beyond healthcare to suitable community organizations capable of addressing their needs. In this linkage process, practitioners knowledgeable about the community play a role in connecting primary care services with community services (South et al., 2008). The services provided by community organizations are highly diverse depending on the local context. The recent prominence of social prescribing in the UK as an extended model of primary care services stems from the rapid increase in patients consulting GPs for non-medical factors due to population aging and complex health problems arising from multifaceted socioeconomic factors (Husk et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2019). In that social prescribing provides opportunities for disease prevention and community participation through socio-economic support mediated by primary care services, it empirically demonstrates the potential for preventive approaches, which social welfare alone could not achieve, to be coordinated jointly with healthcare (Morris et al., 2020; Skillsforcare, 2019).

Recently, several domestic studies have introduced the UK's social prescribing as a policy necessary for introduction into Korea's community care (Kang et al., 2021; Nam, 2020; Song et al., 2019). Song et al. (2019) conducted a social prescribing program in a provincial city to alleviate depression among the elderly, while Kang et al. (2021) introduced regional cases of social prescribing in the UK. These studies focused on program development based on services provided by the community through social prescribing (Song et al., 2019), or on proposing ways to supply personnel from the health education field to fulfill the role of link workers (Nam, 2020; Kang et al., 2021). However, there has been a lack of in-depth literature review examining the characteristics of social prescribing in understanding its preventive role – the reason for its recent emergence at the UK central government level – or what attributes must be secured for effective collaboration between primary care institutions and community organizations in health and social care. In other words, despite the core essence of the social prescribing model being the emphasis on health-social care collaboration as a preventive approach for the UK to ensure a sustainable super-aged society, domestic research focusing specifically on this aspect is currently lacking.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to derive implications for promoting necessary health-social care collaboration in the implementation process of community care policy from a preventive perspective, through an analysis of health-social care collaboration factors perceived by practitioners and users in the field where UK social prescribing has been progressing. The research questions focused on in this study are as follows:

First, what factors influence health-social care collaboration in the UK social prescribing process?

How is social prescribing being implemented?
What are the barriers to health-social care collaboration in social prescribing?
What are the facilitators of health-social care collaboration in social prescribing? Second, what implications do the health-social care collaboration factors identified in the UK social prescribing process hold for Korea's community care policy?

II. UK Social Prescribing

1. What is Social Prescribing?

UK social prescribing can be considered a bottom-up initiative that started pioneeringly at the Bromley-by-Bow health and wellbeing centre in London before the 1990s, subsequently implemented in various models at the local government level, and later gained central government attention (King’s Fund, 2020). As the UK government's policy direction shifted focus towards improving individual health, independent living, and accessibility to community services, social prescribing garnered attention at the central government level (NHS England, 2014). Taking it a step further, the government announced the nationwide expansion of social prescribing through the 'NHS Long Term Plan' in 2019. This plan included measures to increase accessibility to social prescribing services, such as recruiting 1,000 social prescribing link workers into Primary Care Networks (PCNs)*4) by the 2020/2021 fiscal year and enabling at least 900,000 people to use social prescribing services by the 2023/2024 fiscal year (NHS England, 2019). The continuously expanding social prescribing service is gaining further attention during the Coronavirus Disease 19 (Covid-19) pandemic as it helps improve the mental health and well-being of vulnerable and elderly residents isolated due to self-quarantine and social distancing (Cole et al., 2020). In 2016, the Social Prescribing Network held its inaugural conference and, to consolidate the common concepts among the diverse social prescribing models operating nationwide at the time, surveyed stakeholders and derived the following definition:

“Social prescribing involves referring patients to a link worker, to co-design a non-clinical prescription to improve their health and wellbeing (University of Westminster, 2016, 19).”

The activities offered through social prescribing are broad and highly varied, as the available activities differ depending on the community organizations in each region. While some initiatives narrowly focus on clinical aspects with goals like preventing or delaying the progression of chronic diseases (e.g., physical exercise, dietary advice, or cooking), the majority of projects are conducted based on an understanding of the social determinants of health, focusing on the interconnectedness of activity levels, social connection, and mental health (Husk et al., 2020).

The target population for social prescribing includes people with diverse social, emotional, and practical needs, focusing on improving their mental health and physical well-being. Examples include individuals with mild-to-moderate mental health problems, those with chronic conditions like diabetes, vulnerable groups, socially isolated individuals, and frequent users of primary and secondary care services (King’s Fund, 2020). The elderly population constitutes an increasing proportion of social prescribing recipients due to complex issues including not only clinical problems but also loneliness, physical activity levels, and mental well-being (Husk et al., 2020).

2. Outcomes and Models of Social Prescribing

Various social prescribing models exist across the UK. They have different goals and somewhat varying intended outcomes. Table 1 shows a categorized and summarized list of outcomes achieved through projects, compiled from survey responses of 180 stakeholders involved in social prescribing, collected by the Social Prescribing Network in 2016.

Meanwhile, Kimberlee (2015) categorized social prescribing models into four types based on the degree of link worker intervention: 'signposting,' 'light,' 'medium,' and 'holistic.' The social prescribing being expanded nationwide following the 'NHS Long-Term Plan' (2019) announcement is based on the holistic model, with the NHS providing financial support for training link workers and building infrastructure to support social prescribing. In 2020, the UK Department of Health and Social Care invested £5 million to establish the 'National Academy of Social Prescribing' to promote social prescribing initiatives. This non-governmental organization focuses on building an evidence base for social prescribing development, sharing promising practices, supporting community organizations involved in social prescribing, and maintaining partnerships with them (King’s Fund, 2020).

3. Stages of Social Prescribing

Social prescribing proceeds through the following three stages. To aid understanding of how it operates in practice, an example from the Bromley-by-Bow Centre (BBBC) is presented in Table 2.

The first stage is referral, where health professionals refer patients with their consent. Most referrals come from the patient's GP, but other health professionals like practice nurses, specialist nurses, cancer consultants, or psychotherapists may also refer. At this stage, referrals are typically made to a link worker, although in some regional social prescribing schemes, patients might be referred directly to community organizations (University of Westminster, 2017).

The second stage involves the referred patient exploring community services through consultation with a link worker. Link workers, who act as a bridge between primary care institutions and community organizations, are also known by various names such as community connector, community navigator, or social prescribing co-ordinator. They help patients understand what is important to them, identify suitable community resources, and connect them accordingly (University of Westminster, 2017).

The third stage involves the referred patient participating in service activities provided by local voluntary, community, and social enterprise groups. The groups and organizations available for social prescribing referrals vary widely by region. Therefore, when initiating social prescribing, the link worker must have prior knowledge of the organizations capable of accepting referrals and the services they offer in that area (University of Westminster, 2017).

Table 2. An example of social prescribing 1)
Doreen Wilson, 75, from South Yorkshire, describes taking up her social prescription, as “the best thing I ever did”. Doreen had a stroke five years ago and has atrial fibrillation. After her husband died, aged 50, she couldn’t face living on her own, and moved in with her sister.
After her sister passed away, Doreen became very depressed. Her GP recognised this and put her in touch with a link worker, who runs a weekly lunch club. “The first time I went I was nervous of meeting new people and I was very shy, but once I got used to them I was fine.” says Doreen. Each lunch club lasts two hours in a local hall, where everyone sits down to lunch, conversation and a quiz.

III. Methods

1. Meta-ethnography

This study employed the meta-ethnography method (Noblit & Hare, 1988), which analyzes qualitative research literature, to identify health-social care collaboration factors from the perspectives of health and social care practitioners and service users involved in social prescribing. Unlike traditional narrative reviews that summarize existing research or systematic reviews aimed at informing researchers' judgments, meta-ethnography is utilized to synthesize multiple qualitative research studies according to the research question (Britten et al., 2002). Atkins et al. (2008) explained three advantages of meta-ethnography, a method for synthesizing the results of multiple primary qualitative studies, when analyzing and reinterpreting medical intervention programs. First, it can help generate more comprehensive and generalizable theories from the findings of qualitative studies. Second, by focusing on the perspectives of program users, it can add depth to existing systematic reviews of program effectiveness. Third, it can provide insights into the reasons why a program succeeded or failed. Therefore, this literature review method, which integrates and reinterprets qualitative research studies, can provide useful information about program implementation, thereby offering significant implications for future project improvement.

Noblit and Hare (1988) describe the implementation of meta-ethnography in 7 steps as shown in Table 3, but in practice, these steps need not necessarily be followed sequentially and can overlap or occur simultaneously. While the overall stages of applying meta-ethnography are similar to other literature review methods, there are differences in assumption setting and research progression. First, the sampling method is purposive sampling based on the topic of interest, a common sampling method in qualitative research used for interpretive explanation. Second, the interpretations and explanations contained within the original qualitative studies serve as the analytical data. Third, comparison between studies is understood as a translation process. Comparing metaphors, concepts, and their interrelationships within one study to those in another is considered translation. The translation process focuses on finding contextual meaning rather than literal translation (Campbell et al., 2011). The process of integrating translations can be explained as reciprocal translation (direct comparison between studies with similarities), refutational translation (explaining the inherent relationships between studies showing opposing views), or lines-of-argument synthesis (integrating all studies to infer larger themes or phenomena) (Britten et al., 2002).

2. Meta-ethnographic Analysis Steps

The initiation of this study (Step 1) and the determination of topics related to the initial interest (Step 2) began, as explained in the introduction, from seeking a model for health-social care collaboration essential for transitioning towards a sustainable society amidst rapid progression from an aged to a super-aged society, drawing from policies currently gaining attention in developed countries. Subsequently, after learning about the UK's social prescribing through database searches using keywords related to health-social care collaboration, a decision was made to review it. To read the identified research materials (Step 3), the scope of literature synthesis focused on qualitative studies on social prescribing conducted in the UK since 2000, also including mixed-methods studies. From March to June 2020, searches were conducted using Google, Google Scholar, ASSIA, and EBSCOhost, combining terms like 'social pre*', 'community care', and 'health and social care'. The scope included research papers as well as pilot project evaluation reports. Research materials deviating from the research topic were excluded while reading their abstracts. Relevant references from the identified studies and validated qualitative research literature from review articles were manually searched. A manageable number of 23 research documents were finally selected for analysis, as shown in Table 4. Figure 1 illustrates the process of selecting research literature for analysis and the researcher's questions serving as selection criteria. Campbell et al. (2011) suggested that since the meta-ethnography approach is a qualitative synthesis method for deriving high-level concepts, including a small number (up to 40) of studies is appropriate.

(Figure 1. Flow diagram of the process proceeded to select studies - Assumed to be provided)

To define the relationships between studies and translate them reciprocally (Steps 4, 5), the research documents saved as PDF files were coded using ATLAS.ti 8 software, capable of analyzing the main text. Through primary and secondary coding, 34 codes were generated and grouped into 10 code groups to answer the research questions. To compare similarities and differences between studies within each group, quotes from the original data were repeatedly read to extract common underlying concepts. Within the 10 code groups related to the research questions, contrasting and similar concepts were compared to infer themes through a lines-of-argument synthesis (Step 6). To effectively communicate the findings to researchers and policymakers interested in interdisciplinary collaboration issues in healthcare or social welfare (Step 7), the research results were explained as follows.

IV. Research Results

1. Overview of Social Prescribing in the Research Literature

The social prescribing interventions evaluated in the total 23 research documents analyzed in this study were compared based on project period, service user type, type of activity, presence of link workers, and outcomes, as shown in Table 5. This includes studies that separately analyzed the perspectives of health and social care practitioners and service users participating in the same social prescribing initiative. Examples include studies analyzing the 'Arts on Prescription' project (Stickley & Hui, 2012a; Stickley & Hui, 2012b; Stickley & Eades, 2013) and those analyzing the 'Ways to Wellness (WtW)' project (Wildman et al., 2019a; Wildman et al., 2019b). Additionally, to observe the long-term impact and development trajectory of social prescribing, three evaluation reports from the 'Rotherham Social Prescribing Pilot,' which spanned three phases (2012-2017), were included (Dayson & Bashir, 2014; Dayson et al., 2016; Dayson & Bennett, 2017). Among the 15 projects where the period was specified in the literature, 12 occurred in the 2010s, indicating that social prescribing activities have become particularly active relatively recently.

Examining the types of service users in social prescribing reveals two main categories: individuals with chronic conditions and patients at risk of isolation or mild-to-moderate mental health issues (e.g., depression, early dementia). These conditions frequently occur in the elderly population. As individuals age, physical and mental capacities decline, increasing the frequency of comorbid chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis, as well as mental health issues like depression and dementia. Particularly, isolation among the elderly is emerging as a serious social problem. Approximately 13-15% of elderly aged 65 and over in the UK feel isolated, yet many face difficulties in forming social connections to reduce this isolation (Hamilton-West et al., 2020). Therefore, service activities offered through social prescribing (e.g., physical activity, gardening, befriending, arts activities, counseling, education) help improve well-being, health, and address social isolation for elderly individuals with such complex needs. Furthermore, personnel performing roles similar to link workers, connecting primary care institutions and community organizations, existed in social prescribing projects from the early 2000s, although some regions lacked link workers according to the literature. The term 'link worker' itself appeared in social prescribing initiatives starting in the mid-2010s.

Evaluations of social prescribing outcomes were generally positive, with the exception of two research papers (Bertotti et al., 2018; White et al., 2017), although some studies reported mixed results with similar proportions of positive and negative evaluations. For instance, in Bertotti et al.'s (2014) study, while service users experienced improved health, reduced alienation, and enhanced social networks, leading to a positive evaluation, it also pointed out low program completion rates due to poor communication among collaborating agency practitioners, thus presenting a mixed assessment of social prescribing outcomes.

(Table 5. Overview of social prescribing interventions included in this study - Assumed to be provided)

2. Health-Social Care Collaboration Factors in Social Prescribing

Despite UK healthcare policies like the 'NHS Five Year Forward View' (NHS England, 2014) and the 'General Practice Forward View' (NHS Health Scotland, 2016) emphasizing the importance and positive impact of social prescribing at the primary care level, health-social care collaboration remained a significant challenge at the frontline (Bertotti et al., 2018). This was also evident through the research literature analyzed in this study, where the degree of collaboration between health and social care practitioners varied by region or specific practitioners involved in social prescribing. The barriers and facilitators influencing these variations in collaboration were analyzed as follows.

1) Barriers to Health-Social Care Collaboration

(1) Lack of Shared Understanding of the 'Social Model of Health' among Health and Social Care Practitioners
In social prescribing, healthcare professionals, including GPs, act as 'prescribers,' referring patients to utilize non-medical community resources to aid their health recovery. For this to happen, healthcare professionals need to adopt a 'social model of health' perspective, recognizing the need to refer patients to community organizations for issues beyond what clinical treatment alone can address. However, in regions where collaboration between the two sectors was inadequate, GPs tended to remain confined within the 'medical model,' focusing solely on treating patients' diseases, and did not perceive referring patients for non-medical services to community organizations as part of their role. In other words, they determined that social factors affecting patients' health were outside their domain of responsibility (White et al., 2017).

“Is it really my job referring people to the Citizen’s Advice Bureau? Is it my job talking to them about their weight? Those are social things. … We don’t really have that expertise (GP, White et al., 2017, 198).”

GPs, positioning themselves as experts, believed they should hold the authority to solve problems for patients, thus avoiding engagement with social issues they couldn't handle. Conversely, community organization practitioners sought ways to help patients find solutions by taking ownership of their problems or worked with patients to address issues.

“[Doctors] don’t give the service user a lot of time … whereas we give them as much time as they want. Service users come and talk a lot (Community organisation practitioner, White et al., 2017, 199).”

Furthermore, the difference in perspective between practitioners of the two sectors was evident in their preference for quantitative versus qualitative evidence regarding social prescribing effectiveness. Healthcare professionals in regions with hindered collaboration predominantly preferred quantitative evidence clearly visible through clinical figures, tending to devalue qualitative changes in patients' emotional and behavioral states resulting from social prescribing. In Baker and Irving's (2016) study, one GP explained that if evaluations of changes in patient well-being were conducted using objective and quantitative methods, doctors would gain confidence in the necessity of the project.

“Doctors want to see evidence in the way they want to see it… In a way they can trust it’s true (GP, Baker & Irving, 2016, 390).”

While quantitative evaluations of patient well-being improvement or economic effects due to social prescribing are conducted, proving these is often challenging due to difficulties in collecting objective data. Moreover, practitioners in community organizations providing services sometimes expressed concerns about using quantitative data collection tools.

“Always use qualitative evaluation … because I always find that questionnaires don’t tell the story of this project (Community organisation practitioner, Baker & Irving, 2016, 390).”

Baker and Irving (2016) explain the reason for this organization's preference for qualitative tools as follows:

“It is well documented that older people with dementia and depression can find measuring change in their wellbeing difficult due to impaired judgement recall, sensory, motor and communication skills … Most participants struggled to complete questionnaires due to the format, amount and complexity of questions asked and some repeatedly worried about their results (Baker & Irving, 2016, 390).”

Thus, when prescribers (healthcare professionals) and service providers (community organization practitioners) in social prescribing hold conflicting views on perspectives regarding human illness, patient empowerment, and methods for evaluating social prescribing effectiveness, it acts as a stumbling block to mutual respect and collaboration.

(2) Lack of Trust from Primary Care Professionals towards Community Organizations
Since GPs bear legal responsibility for patients' health, they consider whether patients can receive quality services appropriately when referring them to community organizations. Sufficient trust in the quality level of services provided by community organizations must be established for GPs to actively refer patients (Bertotti et al., 2014). However, if prescribing healthcare professionals doubt the service level of community organizations, the act of making social prescriptions inevitably becomes constrained.

“If it was run by education or health [public bodies]…it’s kind of standard. But voluntary sector I don’t know, I couldn’t say it was standard (Nurse, White et al., 2017, 199).”

This perception among healthcare practitioners extended even to community organizations employing trained personnel. This was because healthcare practitioners often lacked information confirming that services provided by many community organizations, unlike potentially lower-quality voluntary organizations, met a certain standard. GPs or nurses relied on limited information about the services offered by community organizations (White et al., 2017).

“I don’t really know exactly what they offer…erm, it’s not something I hear a lot about (Community nurse, White et al., 2017, 199).”

Meanwhile, if primary care professionals cannot trust community organizations, sharing patient personal information becomes difficult, hindering collaboration (Bertotti et al., 2014).

“…confidentiality…That’s the biggest worry for GPs when they’re referring on to a non-NHS body (GP, Whitelaw et al., 2017, 117).”

This issue of sharing clinical information affects the activities of community organizations that need to provide tailored services to patients with various health conditions. In other words, community organizations must spend additional time obtaining sufficient information from primary care institutions before starting activities, and insufficient information can impact service quality improvement.

“Community organisations spent considerable time during initial consultations on patients with varied health conditions. … In cases of unclear diagnoses contact was made with link workers or GPs to obtain more information. This was to avoid risk factors that may arise during the [exercise program] activity (Bertotti et al., 2014, .22).”

For these reasons, some GPs proposed introducing certification systems to enhance trust in the service quality of community organizations or suggested patient risk assessment methods to ensure effective implementation of appropriate social prescriptions (Bertotti et al., 2014). Primary care professionals have been trained to diagnose patients' problems and present solutions, thus positioning themselves as 'experts.' Therefore, unless community organization practitioners can instill confidence that they are trained professionals capable of providing services to patients or demonstrate such capability, referrals for social prescribing are likely to be difficult.

(3) Lack of Feedback Structure between Health and Social Care Institutions
Primary care institutions need feedback on the participation or health improvement of referred patients, while community organizations require specific information about patients' illnesses to plan appropriate activities. Therefore, for primary care institutions to issue social prescriptions and community organizations to continuously and smoothly implement necessary programs accordingly, information acquisition through mutual feedback must be possible and seamless, and the quality of that information is also crucial (Whitelaw et al., 2017). In Whitelaw et al.'s (2017) study area where social prescribing implementation was unsuccessful, GPs attributed the difficulty in continuously referring patients to community organizations to a lack of feedback.

“You constantly have to remember that you can refer patients to that service… because there’s nothing to remind you. You don’t even get an email or a letter back saying ‘thanks for the referral’ (GP, Whitelaw et al., 2017, 118).”

Conversely, in regions where referrals from GPs were sustained, link workers played the role of providing regular feedback to both institutions. Link workers contacted or occasionally met with medical staff to discuss patient needs, and at the final stage of the program, provided feedback documenting the services provided to the patient and the providing organization, supporting medical staff in continuing social prescribing (South et al., 2008). Most importantly, regularly sharing feedback on service users' progress with community organizations and primary care institutions served as a major driving force for sustaining social prescribing.

“…there’s feedback provided for everybody that we see on a monthly basis which goes back to [community organizations] and then they collate all that information for all the different types of social prescribing activity and that goes back to the GPs which helps give a more holistic picture then of that person (Staff member, Dayson et al., 2016, 42).”

Synthesizing the above, in regions where health-social care collaboration in social prescribing was hindered, a shared understanding of the 'social model of health' between practitioners was not achieved, trust between the two sectors was not formed, and a regular feedback structure between institutions was not established. Conversely, the following section will examine how the facilitating factors for collaboration were prepared and functioned in project areas where social prescribing was effectively implemented through inter-sectoral cooperation.

2) Facilitators of Health-Social Care Collaboration

(1) Sufficient Time for Trust-Building between Health and Social Care Practitioners
Sufficient time is necessary for building mutual trust to enable GPs to smoothly refer social prescriptions to community organizations for two reasons. First, time is needed to become accustomed to the new environment, even if roles and responsibilities for referrals are defined. Both GPs and link workers needed some time to adapt to new challenges during the social prescribing referral stage. This involved GPs identifying patients suitable for social prescribing, arranging space within the practice for patients to meet link workers, and establishing systems for link workers to access personal clinical information (Bertotti et al., 2014). One link worker described the experience of lacking work linkage and mutual trust despite being placed in a primary care institution:

“GPs thought that link workers were placed and therefore would take full responsibility for the social prescribing scheme. Staff did not take responsibility for booking appointments [with link workers]. They thought we brought this project and used the practice as venue to run the project independently. They only flagged up potential [social prescribing eligible] patients (Link worker, Bertotti et al., 2014, 19).”

Bertotti et al. (2018) pointed out in an online survey that although all GPs recognize that social prescribing can improve patient well-being, it takes time to trust social prescribing. This is because doctors unfamiliar with social prescribing find it difficult to consider it before medical prescriptions unless constantly reminded of the option through communication with link workers.

Second, time is needed for GPs to trust that community organizations provide services helpful for improving patients' health. Prescribing doctors are reluctant to take referral responsibility if they find it difficult to trust community organizations due to lack of information (White et al., 2017). Doctors need time hearing about patients' positive experiences with social prescribing activities to increase trust in community organizations. For example, in one social prescribing study involving professional community artists conducting art activities with patients (Stickley & Hui, 2012b), GPs acknowledged the safety of the environment provided by the community organization and the professionalism of the practitioners. This was possible because, through the 3-year program, GPs experienced that the art activities went beyond simply creating artwork, appropriately fostering and providing an environment necessary for social therapy, such as opportunities for befriending and increased social contact for patients.

“I think it was useful for people who were socially isolated. People with anxiety or depression tend to avoid mixing with people so they get isolated. Art activities are very therapeutic (GP, Stickley & Hui, 2012b, 583)”

Therefore, collaboration between practitioners in primary care institutions and community organizations requires not only time to adapt to new systems but also time for experiences that enhance understanding of each other's work.

(2) Necessary Communication Opportunities between Health and Social Care Practitioners from the Initial Stages
As seen above, while time is needed for health and social care practitioners to build trust in each other's organizations, this trust-building period can be significantly shortened if relevant practitioners undergo a process of learning about project information and communicating together from the initial stages of the project. Several social prescribing studies showed that significant progress in linkage between health and social care institutions was underpinned by smooth communication at the practitioner level from the initial stages (Skivington et al., 2018; Whitelaw et al., 2017). In one social prescribing project, because all stakeholders met and communicated from the project planning stage, they clearly understood the project, felt a sense of belonging, and were able to continue regular meetings (Whitelaw et al., 2017).

“I think the most positive element to this whole process was having the right stakeholders involved from day one (GP, Whitelaw et al., 2017, 115).”

Thus, medical staff who maintained smooth communication with all relevant practitioners from the beginning were able to relatively quickly resolve initial concerns about patient referrals for social prescribing. Smooth communication established at a personal level between GPs and link workers from the project's outset could also positively impact project sustainability (Skivington et al., 2018). Therefore, even if participating institutions increased during the project, it was necessary for newly joined institutions to go through the same process from the start, just as existing institutions had opportunities for regular communication from the project's beginning. Bertotti et al. (2014) introduced a case where accurate patient referrals were not made because new GP practices joining later did not have sufficient opportunity to be introduced to the project, particularly emphasizing the importance of opportunities for all practitioners to share information and build motivation at the start of work.

“Link workers reported that when new GP practices joined later on, they experienced a repetition of the initial GP experience [lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities]. … The inaccuracy of referrals was corroborated by one participant who attended the evaluation. … However, after GPs had a ‘catching up period’ with link workers, link workers effectively supported the work (Bertotti et al., 2014, 20).”

As such, smooth communication between the two sectors from the initial stages of the social prescribing project enabled GPs to clearly distinguish between patients suitable for social prescribing and those who were not, thereby reducing potential confusion in the process where community organizations provide appropriate services to referred patients. Furthermore, the intervention of link workers in the communication process for linkage between the two institutions from the project's beginning holds considerable influence, thus emphasizing their education and training.

(3) Trained Competency of Link Workers
Patients, primary care institutions, and community organizations – the three main entities in the social prescribing process – have different working methods and perspectives, making communication and collaboration difficult. Therefore, the necessity and importance of link workers as a 'single point' to connect and coordinate these entities are emphasized in several studies (Holding et al., 2020; Skivington et al., 2018; South et al., 2008; Whitelaw et al., 2017; Wildman et al., 2019b).

“Before the link worker was there, it was very, very difficult for reps or workers in community organisations to get a forum with GPs (Community organisation practitioner, Skivington et al., 2018, e490).”

Not all social prescribing projects included in the research literature analyzed for this study had link workers deployed. In White et al.'s (2017) study, which concluded that collaboration was hindered because health and social care practitioners failed to understand each other smoothly, link workers were absent. Meanwhile, even in projects involving link workers, it is noteworthy that there were cases where they failed to act as boundary spanners between health and social care, collaborating only with practitioners within the same field (Baker & Irving, 2016), or where volunteers were assigned the role of link workers, revealing limitations in responsibility and capability (Faulkner, 2004).

Therefore, clearly defining the role of link workers and ensuring sufficient job training is crucial. Woodall et al. (2018) explain the capabilities link workers should possess as follows:

“What has repeatedly been found in the literature published over 10 years is that link workers’ ability to understand health from a social and holistic perspective is critical to the success of social prescribing, and that their interpersonal skills are essential for successful social prescribing planning and improving service satisfaction (Woodall et al., 2018, 605).”

Aspects where link workers need to develop capabilities can be summarized in two points. First, for link workers to induce significant behavioral changes in patients, holistic, person-centered support is needed rather than simply signposting to community services. It is crucial for link workers to develop communication and networking skills that motivate and inspire patients to seize new opportunities or make courageous decisions, and to appropriately apply these skills in their work processes (Wildman et al., 2019b).

“We work quite closely with the client … some people might just say ‘oh just signpost them, that’s all you need to do’ but actually we know our clients, if we did that they probably wouldn’t take up the activity … so we do do that [signposting] but we actually do enabling support as well (Link worker, Wildman et al., 2019b, 994).“

Second, link workers must possess differentiated competencies from health-focused medical professionals in that they need knowledge about various community services.

“It’s important that you’ve got somebody [a link worker] that knows about all these different things, doctors can’t know everything. I mean, they can help me improve my health but I don’t think they know enough about things that are supported in the community (Service user, Wildman et al., 2019a, 103).”

Therefore, establishing a system to train link workers to play a core role between primary care institutions and community organizations is crucial (Wildman et al., 2019b).

Thus, for health and social care practitioners with different values and working styles to collaborate closely in the field, it is essential not only to create a work environment conducive to building mutual trust and provide sufficient time for positive experiences with each other's work, but also to ensure all stakeholders have opportunities to communicate and understand the new project from the initial stages. Furthermore, training competent link workers capable of fully supporting this process is key.

V. Implications and Discussion

This study began with the awareness that for community care, which South Korea is focusing on to transition towards a sustainable welfare society amidst rapid progression from an aged to a super-aged society, to yield results, health-social care collaboration must occur at the frontline. So far, Korea has made significant efforts to promote collaboration between health and welfare. Examples include the Health and Welfare Office pilot project (1995-1999), the legal mandate for linking regional welfare plans under the former Social Welfare Services Act with regional community health plans, integrated case management for comprehensive service linkage across health, welfare, employment, education, etc., under the Social Security Benefit Act, Seoul Metropolitan Government's Outreach Community Service Center project (hereafter, 'Chatdong')*5), the health-welfare linkage policy direction in the Community Integrated Care leading project started in 2019 (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2019a), and the direction presented in the 2nd Basic Social Security Plan to enhance integration among welfare, health & medical care, personal care, and housing services to overcome the limitations of community care (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2019b). However, while there is consensus on the macro-level policy direction, specific policy tools to promote health-social care collaboration have rarely been prepared, nor has their implementation been guaranteed down to the peripheral nerves of policy execution. Incentive systems for collaboration are not significant, and implementation structures have often been unsecured due to unspecified roles and responsibilities. In this respect, the UK's social prescribing can be seen as a very concrete policy tool capable of realizing previously emphasized policy points. The barriers and facilitators of health-social care collaboration in social prescribing revealed in this study hold three major implications for promoting health-social care collaboration in Korea's community care policy.

First, overcoming the barriers of value differences and lack of trust between health and social care sectors requires securing an understanding and practice based on the 'social model of health' perspective. Unlike the UK NHS primary care institutions operated with national funding, primary care clinics in Korea possess characteristics of a healthcare system pursuing profit through market competition with hospitals for the same patient pool (Yim, 2019). Traditionally, Korean primary care has approached patients' health problems primarily from a clinical perspective, with limited engagement towards community-centered social services aimed at resolving social factors closely linked to patients' health. However, the government's expectation for primary care institutions to perform roles that improve residents' health and quality of life from a holistic perspective, spanning both health and welfare domains for chronic disease management and disease prevention beyond just treatment, is seen as no different from the UK's (Cho, 2017). This is evident from the UK strengthening the social prescribing option in primary care institutions, and Korea implementing the 'Primary Care Chronic Disease Management Pilot Project' nationwide since 2019 as part of community integrated care (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2019a).

However, if medical professionals in such projects do not adopt a 'social model of health' perspective considering the social factors surrounding patients' health, vulnerable and isolated patients, like frail elderly, may find it difficult to seize opportunities to change their own health behaviors beyond clinical treatment, potentially leading to cycles of repetitive treatment only. This could eventually lead to easy transition into illness, becoming a burden on medical and care services. Due to rapid aging, Korea's health insurance expenditure on elderly medical costs (proportion) related to care is projected to reach 58 trillion won (50.8%) by the time it enters a super-aged society in 2025, nearly double the 25 trillion won (38.7%) in 2016 (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2019a). This surge in care expenditure threatens the sustainability of the social security system, making a preventive approach – preventing the elderly from becoming ill or detecting and treating illness as promptly as possible if it occurs – urgently necessary (Chun, 2009). Therefore, not only should relevant policies be established to enable primary care medical staff to adopt a social model perspective capable of identifying patients' medical and social needs, but this perspective must also be internalized in actual working methods and communication styles at the frontline.

Second, for substantial collaboration between health and social care to occur at the frontline, measures to build trust and enhance communication between practitioners of both sectors must be established. This includes considering sufficient time for communication from the project's beginning and establishing formal roles for smooth feedback. Firstly, sufficient time must be provided from the project's outset to build trust and facilitate mutual communication, enabling collaboration between health and social care. Evidence that such factors serve as a driving force for the development of community care projects can be found not only in the UK social prescribing project*6) shown in the research results above but also through research on Korea's Health and Welfare Office pilot project. Lee (2010b), interviewing health and social care practitioners from four regions participating in the Health and Welfare Office pilot project (1995-1999) in 2006, analyzed that practitioners from two of the four regions maintained trust relationships even at the time of the research. This was possible because practitioners in these two regions, who had built trust and had ample opportunities for smooth communication while working together at the public health center from the beginning of the 1st pilot project, gained positive experiences by finally implementing collaborative tasks during the 2nd pilot project period. While such communication can occur informally, from a long-term perspective, the research results above confirmed the need for formal roles to ensure smooth feedback between primary care institutions and community organizations.

Third, for health-social care collaboration to lead to community care outcomes, roles similar to social prescribing link workers need to be established. Currently, Korea lacks roles like social prescribing link workers capable of linking community organization services with primary care institutions (Sung, 2019). For example, in the 'Chatdong' project, while welfare planners and visiting nurses are responsible for identifying households in poverty crises and conducting universal home visits respectively, performing tasks that yield results through collaboration with the other sector is structurally difficult due to reporting structures. More importantly, working methods in areas requiring health-social care collaboration are often inefficient. For instance, integrated case conferences held to manage cases requiring long-term and complex management are procedurally inefficient and struggle to secure cooperation from participating institutions, thus failing to provide substantial help (Lee et al., 2020). Furthermore, the 'Primary Care Chronic Disease Management Pilot Project' implemented since 2019 as part of community care recommends deploying care coordinators (nurses or dietitians) for chronic disease education and linkage tasks. While they might link with healthcare institutions, their lack of information about community welfare organizations inevitably limits their ability to achieve substantial outcomes through linkage (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2019a).

This does not mean Korea lacks personnel capable of facilitating linkage with knowledge of community organizations and resources, similar to social prescribing link workers. The closest existing role is the case manager. Originating in the private welfare sector in the 1990s, case managers have been deployed in public domains like townships/municipalities since the mid-2000s, primarily providing services focused on linkage within the social welfare domain (Kim, 2015). In that context, formally changing their working methods to equip case managers with counseling abilities that influence patient health behaviors and foster collaboration with primary care institutions, similar to link workers, could be considered.

Additionally, if detailed implementation specifics are subsequently prepared – such as defining the scope of primary care institutions handling social prescribing, establishing criteria for identifying patients needing social prescriptions, creating reward systems for specific collaborative outcomes, providing detailed standards for link worker qualifications and required competencies, determining the institutional affiliation of link workers and their relationship with existing integrated case management tasks – a concrete policy execution framework could potentially be designed.

*5) The 'Chatdong' project is a welfare delivery system reform project implemented by the Seoul Metropolitan Government to improve the public welfare delivery system and strengthen community self-governance. Starting in 2015 centered around 80 dongs in 13 autonomous districts, the project expanded to 408 dongs (96% of all dongs in Seoul) across 25 autonomous districts by 2018. Seoul's Chatdong project sets core tasks such as strengthening the community safety net through the integration of welfare and health services, beyond just fostering a welfare community through public-private governance, and implements welfare and health services accordingly (Heo et al., 2019, 106).
*6) Among the research papers analyzed in this study, the three Rotherham social prescribing evaluation reports (Dayson & Bashir, 2014; Dayson et al., 2016; Dayson & Bennett, 2017) cover a project that started in 2012 and was extended three times. The Rotherham area subsequently garnered attention as an NHS case study target by continuing the social prescribing pilot project for 8 years until 2020. It is worth noting the trust relationship built through contacts initiated before the pilot project, starting in 2011, between the Rotherham voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector and the Rotherham CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) gained attention (Cole et al., 2020, 30-31).

VI. Conclusion

This study focused on understanding the implementation process of social prescribing and the diverse contexts of barriers and facilitators in health-social care collaboration at the frontline through research literature evaluating various regional social prescribing initiatives conducted in the UK, thereby deriving implications for our society. How to devise a system that can elicit substantial health-social care collaboration modeled after the UK's social prescribing is a task that needs to be tackled moving forward. This will require research analyzing Korea's own social and institutional context for application. However, this study has limitations in that it did not reach the stage of concretizing an actual policy framework within the Korean context.

As mentioned above, future research should address the relationship between medical prescriptions and social prescriptions in primary care institutions, roles and responsibilities among primary care institutions, link workers, and community organizations, and their working methods. Furthermore, it is hoped that research will promptly be conducted on designing the academic background and practical competencies required for link workers, who play a core role, based on the nature and content of their tasks, and how to educate them accordingly.

This study is to derive implications from the experiences of developed countries on collaboration between health and social care. Although the Korean government announced the expansion of community care to solve the growing need for health and social care among the elderly in 2019, there is still a lack of practical health and social care collaborative systems at the frontline. In this respect, social prescribing, which indicates the promotion of the collaboration between primary health care and the community sector in the UK, was analyzed in the light of the elements that implemented joint-working between health and social care at the frontline. Among the research published after the year 2000, twenty-three qualitative and mixed-method types of research related to social prescribing were analyzed according to the seven steps of the meta-ethnography of Noblit and Hare. Based on the findings, barriers included ‘lack of awareness sharing among frontline workers from health and social care’, ‘lack of trust in primary health professionals about the community sector’, and ‘lack of feedback structure between health and social care frontline workers’. Facilitators included ‘sufficient time to build trust’, 'communication opportunities between health and social care frontline workers from the initial stage’, and ‘the trained capabilities of link workers’. The implications of these findings for collaboration between health and social care in Korea were discussed.

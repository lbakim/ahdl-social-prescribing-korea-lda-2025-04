Social Prescribing: Overcoming Social Isolation and Loneliness in the Era of the COVID-19 Outbreak

Abstract

Objectives: Experts have predicted that infectious diseases such as the Coronavirus will reproduce continuously. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the role of health educators in incorporating non-communicable diseases and infectious diseases.
Methods: The social prescription policy trends in the UK were reviewed, and a social prescribing case study was reviewed in Korea.
Results: In the current situation, health educators should be qualified to deliver accurate information about COVID-19. To this end, it will be needed to expand the scope and include jobs such as ‘Social Prescriber’ in the UK.
Conclusion: Health Promotion and Education should be institutionalized changing the current health center-oriented method to emulate the UK’s Social Prescribing system. Also, it is necessary to develop a ‘new health education program’ that includes strategies such as keeping social distance, tele counselling in a pandemic era and online distance learning for health education.   

Key words: COVID-19, loneliness, depression, social prescribing

I. Introduction

Since the first confirmed domestic case of Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) infection on January 20, 2020, the number of confirmed cases reached 9,037 as of March 24 [translator's note: the date in the original text is likely 2020]. Although the rate of increase in confirmed cases has slowed due to recommendations for 'social distancing,' including school closures and assembly restrictions, it is still difficult to predict the end of the infectious disease situation. As of March 24, 2020, the number of confirmed domestic COVID-19 cases was 9,037, and globally, over 357,080 confirmed cases occurred in 194 countries (Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters, 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared on March 11, 2020, that COVID-19 had entered the pandemic phase (WHO, 2020).

The government's response to this coronavirus includes patient detection and treatment services led by the healthcare sector, centered around the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, the executive branch is implementing social distancing and handwashing campaigns as public prevention methods.

When such social risks arise, it is crucial to clearly explain the core problem and its background (Sohn, 2011). However, in relation to this coronavirus, the reality is that social anxiety is being fueled by instances of misinformation dissemination, false information posts on Facebook, and the spread of scientifically unverified information. In response, the government's Korea Communications Commission announced requests for accurate reporting on the novel coronavirus and active countermeasures against information causing social confusion.

Regarding the utilization of social prescribing in the UK, it is estimated that 1 in 5 patients visits a GP (General Practitioner) for non-medical reasons (Christie, 2018). Furthermore, stronger and more systematic evidence regarding the effectiveness of social prescribing is being published in the UK, particularly highlighting its effect in reducing healthcare utilization within the National Health Service (NHS). It is reported that 59% of GPs believe social prescribing can help reduce doctors' workload.

NHS England states that GPs and healthcare professionals can recommend social prescribing services for emotional support. Therefore, for infectious diseases like coronavirus that require social distancing and preventive education, the social prescribing system is expected to expand further in the future. Consequently, this paper aims to review social prescribing cases in the UK and a pilot project in Korea to examine the potential expansion of the duties of health educators during future pandemic outbreaks like the coronavirus.

II. Methods

To achieve the research objective, this study identifies social prescribing cases in the UK and analyzes the content of a pilot project in Korea.

III. Results

Case 1. UK Social Prescribing Examples

In addition to services responding to patient detection and treatment, the UK is considering social prescribing. Therefore, this paper intends to examine how the UK's social prescribing can be applied from a health education and promotion perspective during social crises like the coronavirus pandemic.

The UK introduced the social prescribing system into the NHS starting in 2016 and appointed a Minister for Loneliness to address this issue. This social prescribing system is expected to play a significant role in the current coronavirus situation. The number of citizens required to practice social distancing and self-isolate is increasing in the UK. A social prescribing manager stated, "The coronavirus outbreak will exacerbate anxiety and further isolate people" (Anaka, 2020). Social prescribers provide time for patients to be heard objectively and speak freely about complex issues. They mention, "Our company's social prescribing Link Workers also spend up to six hours in consultation for referral diagnoses related to underlying conditions." According to NHS estimates, approximately 20% of patients seen by GPs daily are for non-medical reasons. Consequently, the NHS in the UK has GPs and healthcare professionals introduce people to social prescribing service organizations for cooperative and emotional support. Social prescribing can be described as a non-clinical alternative where Link Workers (whose role is that of a coordinator) can co-produce solutions with patients suffering from non-medical issues. Particularly, individuals exposed to lonely or isolated environments are given access to social organizations such as community groups, food banks, and volunteering opportunities.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke about the importance of social prescribing in the national effort against the coronavirus at the National Academy for Social Prescribing (NASP) event held on March 12, 2020 (Matt Hancock twitter, 2020). Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of NASP, emphasized the need to strengthen our communities precisely at this time when social distancing is required, highlighting social prescribing activities (Helen Stokes-Lampard twitter, 2020). The method for implementing social prescribing during such isolated times involves conducting remote patient consultations via phone and video calls. Social prescribing beneficiaries are sometimes advised to call a Link Worker first and refrain from seeing a GP while exhibiting severe virus symptoms. This UK social prescribing service is establishing itself as a new health service that can contribute to reducing psychological distress caused by excessive media coverage of the coronavirus, the psychological contraction and loneliness resulting from adherence to social distancing, and the increased loneliness due to the rise in remote work.

Furthermore, Neetside Surgery announced its coronavirus response through a newsletter notice on its homepage. Key social prescribing details are as follows (COVID-19 Read our Newsletter, 2020). The clinic's current operational team promotes that a 'Social Prescriber' is working with them. Dawn Bauling, a Social Prescriber employed by the NHS Primary Care Network, started her duties on September 25, 2019 (Wednesday), supporting patients in various areas of community service. Community services encompassing general health and well-being include bereavement support, respite care, healthy lifestyles, emotional well-being, and outdoor activities for health improvement. The system allows contact with the Social Prescriber either through the responsible GP or directly by the individual via the clinic or email. Her role involves providing consultation upon receiving inquiries via email and creating a link between healthcare institutions and community residents through a Social Prescribing Leaflet. The Social Prescriber is judged capable of fulfilling the function of delivering accurate information between healthcare institutions and the community, suggesting potential benefits for expanding the scope of duties for health educators in Korea in the future.

Case 2. Korean Social Prescribing Pilot Project

The region where Korea's social prescribing pilot project is operating is Heungeup-myeon, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do, implemented since July 2018 as a project funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea. It began as a community care pilot project-type social prescribing initiative, operating a depression reduction program for the elderly for one year, which was reported to be effective (Song, Jo, & Nam, 2019). Following the start of the coronavirus in January 2020, social programs for the elderly were temporarily suspended, and phone-based and outreach social prescribing programs utilizing volunteers are currently underway (Nam et al., 2020). Key components include a depression management social prescribing program run by graduate and undergraduate students studying health education, in collaboration with a local small library. Activities target the elderly and include check-in calls three times a week, delivery of meal side-dishes once a week by volunteers, and provision of coronavirus prevention guidelines. This serves as an alternative program in a situation where group programs cannot be operated due to the coronavirus. It is expected to reduce depression and loneliness among homebound elderly due to the coronavirus by continuously maintaining their connection with society. This activity could become a program applicable when coronavirus outbreaks occur in rural areas, widening social distance while narrowing emotional distance, thus supporting isolated elderly individuals in maintaining social capital even during periods requiring social distancing.

Additionally, Wonju City's Mental Health Center provides phone and face-to-face counseling services for individuals under self-quarantine to manage stress, depression, etc., resulting from quarantine (Wonju Mental Health Center, 2020). Such programs can also be seen as part of social prescribing, indicating a need for future efforts to integrate various existing community programs into a social prescribing system.

IV. Discussion and Conclusion

Experts predict that infectious diseases like the coronavirus will continue to recur in the future. Ben Halschka, a social prescribing manager in Merton, UK, stated, "The coronavirus outbreak will worsen anxiety and isolate people further." The UK currently reports that GPs, nurses, and social workers are overloaded (Anaka, 2020). Social prescribers also provide the necessary time for patients to be heard objectively and speak freely about complex problems.

Social prescribing includes music prescribing, art prescribing, exercise prescribing, reading prescribing, volunteering prescribing, and employment prescribing. Introducing an article by Dr. Hung Te-Jen, a Taiwanese physician, social director, and chairman of the Taiwan Alliance for Healthy Cities, who has been highly active in Taiwan's COVID-19 prevention efforts, regarding social prescribing (Hung, 2020): First, music prescribing is exemplified by people in Italy playing musical instruments on their balconies to soothe anxiety and alleviate emotions. This type of prescription can be utilized in various fields in the future. Second, art prescribing includes activities like art teachers guiding elderly individuals with cognitive decline in drawing at their homes within the community. Third is exercising indoors, on building or apartment balconies, or rooftops. Exercising while getting fresh air in parks, green spaces, mountains, or beaches would be the best form of social prescribing. For example, although cities in Spain were locked down, citizens walking their dogs was reportedly a good stress-relief method, combining pet therapy with exercise prescription. Fourth are green activities and forest therapy that connect people with the natural environment of fields and mountains. Horticulture, such as planting greenery or small green plants in small spaces at home or on a desk, also functions to stabilize emotions. Fifth is reading prescribing. The 'Epidemic Prevention Care Package for Home Stays' provided by the Taiwanese government to citizens under home isolation or quarantine included 14 masks, bleach soap, food items, and, most notably capturing public attention, a 14-day free viewing serial number (including one random audio-visual platform like CATCHPLAY+, myVideo, LINETV). Among these, the most important aspect reported was the significant mental comfort derived from library online recommendations and offline encouragement books or religious texts. Sixth, volunteering improves psychological health and lowers depression and negative psychological symptoms; therefore, encouraging people to volunteer benefits psychological health. Volunteering provides health services and social welfare services along with time and food. In the current COVID-19 crisis, even in countries facing the worst situations like the UK, Spain, and Portugal, retired doctors, nurses, and health professionals are returning as volunteers to handle prevention tasks. This spirit of sacrificial service deserves high praise. Seventh, stable employment allows young people to live on a stable foundation, and even for retired elderly, opportunities for part-time work and paid employment, if physical strength permits, positively affect their mental state during difficult times.

In South Korea, during times like the current coronavirus outbreak, there is a need to expand the existing role of health educators, currently focused mainly on non-communicable diseases, to encompass the domain of infectious diseases. This is because, in situations like COVID-19, health educators must convey accurate information about the disease to the public. To achieve this, it is necessary to expand their scope of duties by adding tasks similar to those of UK Social Prescribers. Furthermore, the methods for health education and promotion사업 need to move beyond the current health center-focused approach towards building community participatory networks in collaboration with various community organizations. This suggests the need to add new health education activities such as remote counseling for isolated populations, phone-based and remote health education, and leaflet production and distribution, in cooperation with local universities and various NGOs.

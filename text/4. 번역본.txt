Evaluation of the effectiveness of a social prescribing pilot project for the elderly using a digital platform in the COVID-19 pandemic

Abstract
 Objectives : As COVID-19 is prolonged, restrictions on movement due to social distancing are adversely affecting the psychological and social health of the elderly. In this study, a social prescribing pilot project was conducted using a digital platform, and its effectiveness was identified.
 Method: A mixed method was conducted that combines quantitative and qualitative research, and a total of 34 participants were included. For quantitative research, homogeneity test of the experimental group and control group, comparison of pre-post scores for measurement variables, and differences in score change were confirmed. In the case of qualitative research, the experiences felt by the subjects were confirmed by using the narrative inquiry method. The period is from April 23 to June 25, 2021, and pre- and post-tests were conducted in the first and last weeks, respectively. The intervention program was conducted once a week for 8 weeks, and data were collected through one-on-one surveys and focus group interviews. The intervention program was a ‘Music storytelling program’ and was conducted using Zoom, a digital platform.
 Results : Compared with the control group, the experimental group showed significantly improved social support (Z=2.82, p=.005) and life satisfaction (Z=2.60, p=.009) scores and significantly decreased depression scores (Z=-2.43, p=.015). And the cognitive function (Z=1.31, p=.189) did not show a significant change. As a result of a focus group interview with 6 participants, the subjects answered that they had experienced ‘relieving the frustration caused by COVID-19’, ‘the enjoyment of programs using digital platforms’, and ‘expanding social networks’.

 Conclusion : It was confirmed that the social prescribing pilot project using a digital platform was effective in promoting the psychological and social health of the elderly, and it is thought that it will have a positive effect on revitalizing the community stagnated by COVID-19. Furthermore, this study can be provided as evidence to seek a new way of social prescribing as a part of Korea's community care policy.

I. Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) designated individuals aged '60 and over' as a high-risk group for COVID-19 and urged special attention to elderly health management (1). However, due to the characteristics of the elderly who require various services such as health promotion, preventive services, primary care, specialized treatment, long-term care, and welfare (2), social distancing, the primary preventive measure against COVID-19, is adversely affecting their health. Restrictions on social activities resulting from social distancing are causing mental health problems like depression (3,4) and reducing their quality of life and life satisfaction. Furthermore, reduced physical activity exacerbates chronic underlying diseases (5) and also impacts the cognitive function decline in the elderly (6). According to a recent domestic study targeting older adults, restrictions on movement and physical activity due to COVID-19 intensify feelings of depression and isolation among the elderly. With the suspension of facilities frequented by the elderly, such as senior centers and welfare centers, they report feeling more boredom than before (7). Additionally, lack of physical activity due to COVID-19 can lower immunity, potentially increasing the risk of respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and sarcopenia (8). In essence, COVID-19 not only directly impacts the elderly as a high-risk infectious disease but also has direct and indirect effects on their physical, mental, and social aspects.

Many solutions are being proposed to overcome the problems associated with social distancing policies due to COVID-19. The need for elderly services utilizing digital platforms like Skype, Zoom, and YouTube is emerging, and actual demand is increasing (9,10). Recently, domestic dementia relief centers and elderly welfare centers are providing cognitive rehabilitation programs and cultural activity services for the elderly using digital platforms to address mental health issues arising from COVID-19. As restrictions on social activities significantly impact the health and quality of life of the elderly, intervention programs utilizing digital platforms that can be implemented while maintaining social distancing are being developed.

Meanwhile, the UK implements a community-based 'social prescribing' system. Introduced by the UK NHS in 2016, social prescribing refers to providing non-pharmacological assistance available within the community rather than medication prescriptions to citizens experiencing mental and emotional difficulties (11). The goal of social prescribing extends beyond treating illness; it aims to improve health and quality of life by addressing health problems stemming from social causes. Social prescribing programs include various activities available for community participation, such as arts activities, physical activities, and community volunteering. Recent research suggests that social prescribing can alleviate the mental distress caused by social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the need for close community linkage and cooperation for effective management (12). Accordingly, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke about the importance of social prescribing in the national effort against COVID-19 at the National Academy for Social Prescribing (NASP) event on March 12, 2020 (13). Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of NASP, also highlighted the importance of social prescribing in strengthening communities during the socially distancing era of COVID-19 (14).

Due to the spread of COVID-19, the delivery method of social prescribing is also changing, incorporating digital platforms. Before COVID-19, social prescribers conducted needs assessments, service linkage, and monitoring through face-to-face meetings with patients. However, as face-to-face contact became difficult after the outbreak, digital social prescribing attempts emerged to intervene remotely (15). The UK, a leader in social prescribing, is actively utilizing digital platforms not only in service delivery but also in the delivery process and monitoring, such as developing the online digital social prescribing platform 'ELEMENTAL SOFTWARE' (16).

Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of a social prescribing pilot project for the elderly utilizing a digital platform, implemented centered around the community during the COVID-19 period. The specific objectives are as follows:

First, to confirm changes in depression and cognitive function among the elderly before and after the social prescribing pilot project.
Second, to confirm changes in perceived social support and life satisfaction among the elderly before and after the social prescribing pilot project.
Third, to confirm the psychological and social changes experienced by the elderly after participating in the social prescribing pilot project.

II. Methods

1. Research Design

This study hypothesized that the social prescribing pilot project, as an intervention program, would positively affect participants' depression, cognitive function, perceived social support, and elderly life satisfaction. A mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative research was employed. For the quantitative research, a Non-equivalent Pretest-Posttest control group design was utilized to examine the treatment effects on the experimental group (receiving the social prescribing program) compared to the control group (not receiving it). For the qualitative research, focus group interviews were conducted (Figure 1).

2. Overview of Research Area

The research areas were Heungeup-myeon and Munmak-eup in Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. The specific background for selecting these areas is as follows:
First, Gangwon-do has a higher aging rate compared to other provinces and metropolitan cities. As of August 2021, Jeollanam-do had the highest aging rate nationwide at 24.0%, followed by Gyeongsangbuk-do (22.3%), Jeollabuk-do (21.9%), and Gangwon-do (21.3%) (17).
Second, the aging rate is high in these specific areas, with Heungeup-myeon at 21.32% and Munmak-eup at 19.47%. Heungeup-myeon has already entered a super-aged society (18).
Third, as of August 2021, Wonju-si had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Gangwon-do (1,126), followed by Gangneung-si (980) and Chuncheon-si (707) (19).

3. Study Participants

The study subjects were elderly individuals aged 65 and over residing in Heungeup-myeon and Munmak-eup, Wonju-si, Gangwon-do. Detailed participant selection criteria were as follows:
First, elderly individuals recommended by local social workers as having no issues participating in the pilot project.
Second, elderly individuals capable of routine communication and without hearing or visual impairments.
Third, elderly individuals not identified with severe depression based on the Geriatric Depression Scale-Korean version (GDS-K) score being 22 or lower during the pre-survey.

A total of 35 participants were recruited. Twenty elderly individuals willing to participate were assigned to the experimental group, and 15 unwilling to participate were assigned to the control group. However, during the study period, one participant from the control group was hospitalized, resulting in 20 participants in the experimental group and 14 in the control group included in the final analysis.

4. Data Collection and Measurement Tools

4.1. Quantitative Research
Data for quantitative research were collected through 1:1 surveys. The questionnaire included questions to determine participants' socio-demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics (depression, cognitive function), and social characteristics (perceived social support, life satisfaction). The survey was conducted twice, before and after the intervention program. Two researchers with health science backgrounds conducted the surveys through face-to-face visits using a 1:1 interview method. The average survey time was approximately 40 minutes per elderly participant. Detailed descriptions of the measurement tools are provided in Table 1.

(Table 1. Questionnaire contents - Assumed to be provided in English with details like Cronbach's alpha)

4.2. Qualitative Research
Data for qualitative research were collected through focus group interviews. Using purposive sampling, 6 participants from the pilot project were selected as research subjects. Focus group interviews were conducted one week after the pilot project ended (June 25). All 6 research subjects consented to the interview. The average interview time was 40 minutes, structured with 15 minutes of interview, followed by a 10-minute break, and concluded with the remaining 15 minutes. A semi-structured questionnaire was used, adapted and translated from the social prescribing evaluation tool used in Durham, UK, to fit the purpose of this study (24).
Key questions included items asking about satisfaction with the social prescribing program and the appropriateness of this program conducted during the COVID-19 period.

5. Intervention Program

The social prescribing program used in this pilot project was the Music Storytelling program, conducted in compliance with social distancing guidelines considering the COVID-19 situation. Music Storytelling combines Music, personal Story, and counseling (Telling and Counseling). It is a music therapy technique aimed at discovering inner stories and leading towards a better life, with the purpose of restoring self-esteem and forming hope and vision for life. The Music Storytelling program, detailed in Table 2, consists of activities designed to strengthen 7 domains (cognitive, sensory, language, physical, self, mind-body, intimacy). This program received a service mark registration from the Korean Intellectual Property Office in 2013 (Registration No. 41-0270261) and can elicit positive effects such as psychological and emotional stability, leading to inner change among participants (25).

This intervention program was conducted by two Music Storytelling experts via the digital platform Zoom (video conferencing software), allowing for real-time interaction and immediate feedback with participants. To prevent COVID-19 infection, participants were divided into several small groups of fewer than 5 people. They participated by watching TV and PC screens set up at each location. Each group included one student volunteer. A total of 13 student volunteers were recruited from students attending three universities located in the region. They received pre-training once a week for three weeks prior to the program start, ensuring sufficient understanding before participation. The program ran once a week for a total of 8 sessions from April 30, 2021, to June 18, 2021. Considering the number of participants, it was conducted simultaneously via video conference at multiple locations. Each session lasted 60 minutes. Program locations included community-linked institutions near participants' residences, such as small libraries, senior centers, and village management offices.

To ensure safety from COVID-19 infection, thorough disinfection was carried out before each session, including all items used by participants like instruments, desks, and chairs. Additionally, temperatures of all participants were measured and recorded before participation, and wearing masks and disposable gloves was mandatory.

6. Data Analysis

6.1. Quantitative Research
Quantitative data were analyzed using the SPSS Statistics 25.0 version statistical package. Considering the small size of the specific group samples, non-parametric statistical methods were used for verification. Specific methods were as follows:
First, to test for homogeneity between the experimental and control groups, the independent samples Mann-Whitney U Test and Fisher's Exact test were conducted on socio-demographic variables, depression, cognitive function, perceived social support, and life satisfaction variables.
Second, to determine if there were significant differences in pre-post scores for depression, cognitive function, perceived social support, and life satisfaction within the experimental and control groups after the intervention program, the paired samples Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was performed.
Third, to ascertain if there were significant differences in the pre-post score changes between the experimental and control groups for depression, cognitive function, perceived social support, and life satisfaction variables, the difference between post-test and pre-test scores for each group was calculated, followed by an independent samples Mann-Whitney U Test.

6.2. Qualitative Research
Qualitative data were analyzed using the narrative inquiry method proposed by Clandinin and Connelly (2000), following these steps:
First, transcribed data were repeatedly read to accurately grasp the meaning of the interview content. When meanings were unclear, the audio recordings were re-listened to, or participants were contacted directly by phone to confirm the content. Subsequently, through axial coding and open coding categorization, the data were structured into research text, and participants' stories were composed in a narrative format. Finally, the narratives constructed by the researcher were shared with the research participants for feedback, and the narratives were reconstructed based on this feedback.

7. Ethical Considerations

This study received approval from the Yonsei University Mirae Campus Institutional Review Board (IRB Management No: 1041849-202109-SB-137-03).

III. Research Results

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of a social prescribing program utilizing a digital platform on the elderly. The results of analyzing the program's application effects are as follows:

1. Homogeneity Test between Experimental and Control Groups

The results of testing the baseline homogeneity between the experimental and control groups regarding socio-demographic characteristics, depression, cognitive function, perceived social support, and life satisfaction are presented in Table 3. The average age was 79.60 years for the experimental group and 80.50 years for the control group, with no statistically significant difference (p=.666). Both groups had a higher proportion of females (Experimental: 85.0% female, 15.0% male; Control: 64.3% female, 35.7% male), with no significant difference (p=.228). Literacy rates were high in both groups (Experimental: 95.0% literate; Control: 85.7% literate), showing no statistical difference (p=.555). More than half of the participants in both groups had a religion, and homogeneity was confirmed between groups (p=.455). Specifically, religious affiliations were: Experimental - Christian 5 (25.0%), Catholic 1 (5.0%), Buddhist 3 (15.0%), Atheist 11 (55.0%); Control - Christian 5 (35.7%), Catholic 2 (14.3%), Buddhist 3 (21.4%), Atheist 4 (28.6%). Regarding living arrangements, 11 (55.0%) in the experimental group lived alone, while 9 (45.0%) lived with others. In the control group, 11 (78.6%) lived alone, and 3 (21.4%) lived with others; homogeneity was confirmed (p=.275). For subjective health level, the most common response in both groups was 'bad' (Experimental 35.0%, Control 57.1%), and the least common was 'very good' (Experimental 5.0%, Control 7.1%), with no statistically significant difference between groups (p=.747).

Baseline depression scores were higher in the experimental group (Mean=17.00) than the control group (Mean=12.57), but the difference was not statistically significant (U=91.00, p=.090). Similarly, cognitive function scores showed no significant difference between groups (Experimental Mean=22.90, Control Mean=24.21; U=97.00, p=.138). Perceived social support scores were also similar (Experimental Mean=22.45, Control Mean=22.00; U=133.50, p=.823), as were life satisfaction scores (Experimental Mean=17.95, Control Mean=21.14; U=113.50, p=.359). Consequently, homogeneity between the experimental and control groups was confirmed for all measured variables.

2. Effects of the Social Prescribing Program

2.1. Comparison of Pre-Post Scores within Experimental and Control Groups
The results comparing pre-post scores within the experimental and control groups after the intervention program are shown in Table 4. In the experimental group, the average depression score significantly decreased from 17.00 pre-test to 13.35 post-test (Z=-2.43, p=.015). Conversely, cognitive function increased from an average of 22.90 pre-test to 23.65 post-test, but this change was not statistically significant (Z=1.31, p=.189). Perceived social support scores significantly increased from an average of 22.45 pre-test to 27.65 post-test (Z=2.82, p=.005). Life satisfaction scores also significantly increased from an average of 17.95 pre-test to 23.25 post-test (Z=2.60, p=.009).

In the control group, the average depression score decreased slightly from 12.57 pre-test to 12.36 post-test (-.21 points), but the difference was not statistically significant (Z=-.05, p=.959). Cognitive function scores also showed no significant change between pre-test and post-test averages (Z=1.74, p=.083). Perceived social support scores decreased from an average of 22.00 pre-test to 18.57 post-test (-3.43 points), but this decrease was not statistically significant (Z=-1.58, p=.114). Finally, life satisfaction increased slightly from an average of 21.14 pre-test to 21.50 post-test (+.36 points), but this increase was also not statistically significant (Z=.19, p=.850).

(Table 4. Comparison of pre and post scores of the experimental and control group - Assumed to be provided in English with details)

2.2. Comparison of Pre-Post Score Changes between Experimental and Control Groups
The results comparing the changes in depression, cognitive function, perceived social support, and life satisfaction scores between the experimental and control groups are presented in Table 5. Depression scores showed an average decrease of -3.65 points in the experimental group versus -.21 points in the control group, a statistically significant difference between the groups (Z=-2.09, p=.036). For social support, the experimental group participating in the social prescribing program showed a significantly greater increase in scores compared to the non-participating control group; notably, the control group's social support scores actually decreased post-test compared to pre-test (Z=-2.94, p=.003). Life satisfaction increased by an average of 5.30 points in the experimental group versus .36 points in the control group, demonstrating a significant difference in score change between the groups (Z=-2.00, p=.047). Lastly, cognitive function scores increased in both groups post-test compared to pre-test (Experimental: avg. +.75, Control: avg. +1.07), but the difference in change between the groups was not statistically significant (Z=-.23, p=.823) (Figure 2).

2.3. Participant Interview Results
Analysis of the focus group interview data revealed that participants' experiences in this pilot project were interpreted as: "Relief from frustration caused by COVID-19," "Enjoyment of programs using digital platforms," and "Expansion of social networks."

2.3.1. Relief from Frustration Caused by COVID-19
Participants mentioned that due to COVID-19, going outside and meeting friends and family was difficult. They expressed experiencing physical and emotional hardship as a result. Participating in this program helped alleviate the stress and frustration stemming from this situation. They also noted that because the program adhered to disinfection guidelines, their anxiety about COVID-19 was low. Thus, participation in the social prescribing pilot project helped alleviate the participants' frustration caused by COVID-19.

"Because of COVID, I just laid around at home all day long, really. Except when I absolutely had to go out to buy necessities, I stayed inside because I was scared. So I was very frustrated, and my mood was down, it was really hard. But coming out like this improves my mood, and meeting the student teachers (student volunteers) is so nice... People really need to meet others and get some fresh air outside." – Ms. P (F), 90 yrs
"Old people like us can't go out anywhere because we're scared of COVID, unless local people ask us to come out like this... Thanks to this, I feel relieved inside." – Ms. L (F), 81 yrs
2.3.2. Enjoyment of Programs Using Digital Platforms
All six participants mentioned that this was their first experience with a digital platform (Zoom), and the novelty contributed to their enjoyment. Communicating through a screen rather than seeing the instructor's face directly felt unfamiliar. They particularly mentioned enjoying receiving remote lectures from a Korean music expert based in the United States. Although they initially struggled to adapt to the program using the digital platform, they gradually became accustomed to it over the sessions and found that this novelty actually helped them immerse themselves more in the lectures. This confirmed that participants experienced enjoyment from the program utilizing a digital platform.

"In my 80+ years, this is the first time I've done an activity like this, my goodness... It's so amazing that conversation is possible without even meeting... Because it's amazing, I keep watching and following along, you know?" – Ms. K (F), 76 yrs
"They said one of the music therapists was in America... At first, I thought they were just playing a recording, but it was truly amazing to greet each other and talk through the TV." – Ms. L (F), 81 yrs
2.3.3. Expansion of Social Networks
Participants stated that participating in this pilot project allowed them to form new relationships with program instructors and student volunteers, and they could also share intimacy with fellow participants. Especially during a time of limited social interaction due to COVID-19, they expressed that simply talking with new people while participating in this pilot project was enjoyable, and they wished to participate in similar activities in the future. This confirmed the expansion of participants' social networks.

"Maybe because of COVID, I couldn't meet anyone except my husband, but meeting these young teachers like this makes me feel younger too. It feels like I've gone back to my student days." – Ms. K (F), 85 yrs
"Now we can't help but avoid meeting in large groups, but it's nice that we can still have fun like this in small numbers... Last time, I even exchanged numbers with the elder (hyeongnim) next to me, and now we call each other when we're bored." – Ms. P (F), 83 yrs
IV. Discussion

This study investigated the effects of a social prescribing pilot project utilizing a digital platform on elderly participants' depression, cognitive function, perceived social support, and life satisfaction. The experimental group participating in the pilot project showed statistically significant improvements in perceived social support and life satisfaction scores, and a significant decrease in depression scores compared to the non-participating control group. Reviews of social prescribing cases in the UK indicate that it helps promote the physical and mental health of the general public, and similar results were found in studies targeting the elderly population (26). With depression reduction recognized as a primary goal of social prescribing (27), this study consistently showed a decrease in participants' depression levels. Furthermore, aligning with previous research indicating a negative relationship between depression and perceived social support/life satisfaction (28), this study found that the social prescribing pilot project led to decreased depression and significantly increased social support and life satisfaction. Notably, unlike other variables, perceived social support showed opposite results for the control group compared to the experimental group. This is likely because COVID-19 induced unwanted social isolation among the elderly, negatively affecting their perceived social support. Research conducted in Alameda County, California, USA, found a strong correlation between social support and lifespan, stating that social support is a crucial factor protecting the mental health of the elderly due to its close association with psychological protective factors like resilience (29). Studies on elderly mental health during COVID-19 indicate that the elderly experience unwanted social isolation, and minimizing the resulting mental distress requires connection with the community and social support utilizing digital platforms (30). In other words, since reduced social support due to COVID-19 negatively impacts elderly health, social prescribing programs that protect their mental health can be considered effective solutions. Moreover, social prescribing projects connecting community resources via digital platforms are appropriate interventions for the COVID-19 era.

Conversely, although the experimental group's cognitive function improved somewhat after the pilot project, the change was not statistically significant, nor was the difference significant compared to the control group. This finding contradicts studies on cognitive function in elderly participating in social activities (31,32). This might be because the 8-week duration was too short to improve participants' cognitive function significantly, suggesting this result needs consideration when promoting future social prescribing projects for dementia prevention.

Amidst worsening social and health inequalities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, social prescribing projects aimed at improving individual health and well-being are increasingly necessary (33). However, traditional social prescribing targeting large groups poses health risks to participants during the COVID-19 period and is practically impossible under government social distancing guidelines. Consequently, projects utilizing digital platforms are being developed and operated in various fields tailored to the pandemic situation (34), with evidence suggesting that digital platform-based approaches may be more effective than traditional face-to-face methods for promoting mental health (35,36). Research on nursing home residents indicated that smartphone video conferencing programs helped improve participants' loneliness and pain, and other studies found that digital platform-based services enhanced the mental well-being of the elderly (37,38). Additionally, digital methods, alongside therapeutic means, can provide supplementary audiovisual materials, thereby increasing participant motivation and helping alleviate anxiety (35,36). This study utilized appropriate audiovisual materials like related photos and videos in each session via the Zoom video conferencing program, and proceeded with real-time feedback between instructors and participants, indicating successful implementation of a digital platform-based approach.

The elderly generally have lower levels of access to and literacy regarding digital technology compared to other age groups (39). All participants in this pilot project encountered the Zoom medium for the first time and reported a lengthy adaptation period. However, with the help of instructors and student volunteers present, they were able to participate smoothly. Although this pilot project might be seen as raising the entry barrier for elderly participation due to its use of digital media, the fact that this challenge was overcome using local resources suggests that future social prescribing programs utilizing digital platforms can be well-utilized even by elderly individuals unfamiliar with digital technology.

Furthermore, a previous study on a social prescribing pilot project for the elderly implementing the same intervention program face-to-face reported a decrease in depression scores (GDS-K) from 13.60 pre-test to 10.00 post-participation (40). That study also targeted elderly aged 65 and over, differing only in the delivery method of the intervention program. This result is similar to the findings of the present study using the same scale (GDS-K) (Pre: 17.00, Post: 13.35). Considering that the magnitude of decrease was actually 0.05 points greater in our study, it can be inferred that this pilot project utilizing a digital platform was at least as effective as the traditional social prescribing pilot project.

Focus group interviews with 6 participants revealed that through participation in this pilot project, they experienced "Relief from frustration caused by COVID-19," "Enjoyment of programs using digital platforms," and "Expansion of social networks." These findings can be interpreted as reinforcing the quantitative results of this study, which showed the effectiveness of the social prescribing program in reducing depression. Additionally, the appropriateness of using a digital platform, which was difficult to assess quantitatively, was confirmed through these interviews. The fact that all participants were unfamiliar with the video conferencing program, yet this unfamiliarity actually increased their interest and motivated more active participation, indicates the successful implementation of the social prescribing pilot project using a digital platform. Participants also reported expanding their social networks through this activity, which further strengthens the quantitative results and aligns with previous research showing that expanded social networks improve elderly social support, which in turn effectively reduces depression (41).

According to the UK NHS, community-based social prescribing promotes individuals' social contact, enabling them to escape social isolation and loneliness, ultimately contributing to personal health promotion. The social prescribing pilot project conducted in this study also sufficiently utilized community institutions such as small libraries, senior centers, and village management offices, recruited nearby university student volunteers for the project, and employed social prescribers to link participants with community institutions, demonstrating similarity in process to UK social prescribing. These elements can be seen as improving the health of participants physically and mentally exhausted by COVID-19. Therefore, to address the health problems the elderly may face due to COVID-19, it will be necessary to establish a Korean-style community care social prescribing model centered around the community (42). Furthermore, despite the national disaster situation caused by COVID-19, there is a need to explore the introduction of intervention programs utilizing digital platforms that can be implemented while maintaining social distancing.

The limitations of this study are as follows. First, the sample size is small, and the study targeted elderly individuals in specific rural areas with high aging rates, so caution is needed when generalizing the research findings. Second, this study is closer to descriptive research, thus having significant limitations in establishing causality. Finally, the assessment of the impact of participating in the social prescribing pilot project on participants' psychological and social health is limited to short-term evaluation, preventing conclusions about the sustainability of the intervention's effects. Therefore, future research should verify the sustainability of elderly health improvements through follow-up observations and confirm the effectiveness of social prescribing through expansion to urban areas.

V. Conclusion

Evaluating the effectiveness of the social prescribing pilot project for the elderly using a digital platform confirmed the following points:

Participants in the social prescribing pilot project experienced more positive changes in depression, social support, and life satisfaction compared to non-participants. Focus group interviews with 6 participants revealed experiences of ‘relief from frustration caused by COVID-19,’ ‘enjoyment of programs using digital platforms,’ and ‘expansion of social networks.’ Based on these findings, community-based social prescribing pilot projects can be considered effective for the mental and social health of the elderly. Furthermore, the approach utilizing a digital platform was implemented appropriately and timely, proving potentially as effective as face-to-face methods. Therefore, it is expected that social prescribing pilot projects using digital platforms can positively impact elderly health worsened by COVID-19 and contribute to revitalizing stagnant communities. Moreover, this study can serve as evidence for exploring social prescribing as a new approach within Korea's community care policy.
